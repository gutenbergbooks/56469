<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>I feel that this short sketch of a Persian town
needs an apology. It will not improbably be
mistaken for a book of travel. Stopping five years
in one place is not travelling, and the experience
of such a stay is not a traveller’s experience. The
descriptions that will be found in this volume
refer to a very small area, and consequently a
good deal of minute work has been attempted
that would have been out of place in the painting
of a larger sphere.</p>

<p>Then, again, this is not a book upon mission
work. There is comparatively little about the
very interesting work which is being carried on
in Yezd by the Church Missionary Society, but
there is a great deal about the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
under which missionaries work, for the book is
really a description of a Persian town from the
missionary point of view. This will explain why
certain details, such as the dress and food of the
people, are left out altogether; for, although there
may be some connection between these things
and the kind of way in which missionary work
ought to be conducted, it is not at present apparent
to the writer. On the other hand, the general
effects of house, street, and desert, which meet
the Yezdi’s eye at every turn, have been rather
elaborately described, for scenery and scenic surroundings
have much effect on character, and
the study of character is essential in missionary
work.</p>

<p>In most of the descriptions I have taken
special care to preserve the true proportion between
good and evil, so far as I have been able
to estimate it in the thing described. I have
specially done this in the necessarily incomplete
sketches which I have drawn of the Yezdi’s character
and religious beliefs. But in dealing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
the Persian Government I have consciously
deviated from this practice. Consequently, I must
ask the reader to regard all references to the
Government as going no further than the actual
statements. I have also, as far as possible, avoided
alluding to political problems; for, in a country
like Persia, for a man engaged in serious missionary
work abstention from politics is almost a
<i>sine qua non</i>.</p>

<p>It will, perhaps, be felt by some that more
ought to be made of the points in common between
Islam and Christianity. The fact is that
when people come to the missionary they do not
want to find agreement but disagreement, and
consequently the missionary gets to think not so
much of what they know as of what they do
not know. So a missionary writer is, perhaps,
inclined to pass over common points, whatever
religion he is writing about. In the case of
Islam there are really not many to note, and in
support of this statement I may relate a story
told by an officer of Indian troops. One day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
a Mohammedan, in the course of a conversation,
said to him: “Of course, Sahib, your
religion and ours are very near together. Your
Christ is one of our prophets.” My friend
replied: “What do you mean? Of course Christ
is one of your prophets, but to us He is more than
a prophet; He is the Son of God and the pattern
of our lives. Besides there is hardly a single
practical point where Mohammedans and Christians
are not entirely at issue.” The man looked up
and said: “Sahib, you have read the Quran, and
you have read your Bible. I always make that
remark to Christians: I made it to a padre the
other day: and they almost always say, ‘Very
true; Mohammedanism has a great deal in
common with Christianity.’ Well, Sahib, when
they say that, I know that they have not read
the Quran and they have not read their Bibles.”</p>

<p>My best thanks are due to Miss <span class="smcap">Mary Bird</span>,
whose name is well known both in Persia and to
all interested in that country, for the valuable
assistance that she has given me out of the wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
and unique experience that she possesses on the
subjects handled in my book. I am also very
grateful to the Rev. G. <span class="smcap">Furness Smith</span> for several
valuable suggestions.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the Rev. <span class="smcap">C. H. Stileman</span>
and to Mr <span class="smcap">Paul Peter</span> for some of the photographs
illustrating the book. The coloured prints
and the picture of the School are from drawings
by a native artist, <span class="smcap">Mirza Abu’l Qasim</span>.</p>

<h1>FIVE YEARS IN A PERSIAN TOWN</h1>

</div>

<p>In the very centre of central Persia there is a
town called Yezd, which in some ways may be
uninteresting, but ought for a student of Persia
to have the greatest interest, for it possesses all
the regular attributes of a Persian town to an
exaggerated degree. These Persian towns can
be better understood after some consideration of
the country in which they lie. Some one, I think,
has said that Persia consists of two parts, the salt
desert, and the desert which is not salt; and
though this is not true of all parts of Persia, with
regard to most of the interior of Persia it is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
nearly true as a reasonable man can expect an
aphorism to be. In the vast district where Yezd
lies you find an archipelago, with sand for sea,
and towns and villages for islands. If you want
to know how big that desert area is, I can only
tell you that we went to Yezd, which lies in
the very centre of Persia, from the southern
shore of the Caspian, which is the northern
boundary of the country, and with the exception
of a belt of land at the extreme north about
thirty miles broad, and a patch round Teheran
about twenty miles across, we literally passed
through nothing but desert.</p>

<p>But desert in Persia is of many kinds: even
the salt desert is not all the same. There are
places where the ground is absolutely bare, except
for the thick crusts of salt that lie like snowdrifts
streaking the surface in every direction. There
are also places equally salt where the proximity of
a certain amount of useless water produces a larger
quantity of plant life than in most parts of the
ordinary desert. The ordinary desert is good soil,
and wherever water can be brought to it, it is
extremely fertile. Generally it has a hard but
rather gravelly surface. Sometimes it is flecked
with dry brownish shrubs about the size of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
bedding-out plants, sometimes it is quite bare.
There is in parts a good deal of scattered growth,
but two plants never touch one another. In the
more favourable places shrubs may be found at
an average of not more than two yards apart,
but, with one exception, I have never seen in the
desert plains of central Persia a place away from
the hills with sufficient natural growth to modify
the colour of the distance.</p>

<p>Then there is the sandy desert. Here also, if
the sand is scraped away and water brought, the
soil is good, but in appearance the sandy desert is
the most desolate of all. Absolutely nothing
grows on it. It is like the worst kind of salt
desert, without the relief of the white patches.
Yezd lies in a big stretch of sandy desert. Sometimes
the sand may be broken by a large piece of
gravelly plain, but such places are generally as
bare as the sands themselves, and form no real
break in the dull monotony.</p>

<p>Of course there are oases; but what is called an
oasis is not really very different in character from
the desert that surrounds it. It is the same desert
artificially cultivated. In the plains the water is
brought from a distance, and when it is applied the
ground consents to nourish exactly those seeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that have been sown. There are hardly any
weeds, no turf, no tangle, no hedges, and no waste
green. Every blade in the artificial wheat-field is
an isolated unit, that may be pulled up without
disturbing its neighbour. Even in the fresher-looking
gardens, enclosed and concealed by high
mud walls, there is the same meagre, bedded-out
appearance on every side. In spite of the possibility
of three artificial harvests in the year, one
sees at a glance that the very roots will inevitably
be annihilated when the water is cut off, and of
course this happens pretty frequently. There are
no wild trees at all, and those that are reared are
very small, and scanty in leafage. Such oases as
these go by different names, according to the
quantity of water. Those that can support a
fairly large population are towns, those that can
support a smaller one are villages, those that can
only support one or two households are called
cultivations, or <i>mazra’s</i>. But, however big or
however small, they are no interruption to the
continuity of the desert.</p>

<p>In the hills and round their bases there is a
trifle more plant life, but there is no strong
contrast to the barrenness below. Only high up in
the creases of the mountain sides, right above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
cultivations and villages, there are the narrowest
strips of turf on either side of the snow torrents.
Here one may find small ferns nestling under the
boulders, and quantities of soft flowers, or an
occasional wild barberry bush. Away from the
actual bed of the mountain streams one is again in
desert of a kind, though here, too, the scattered
dry shrubs will be found alternating with more
succulent varieties of plants, and the landscape is
by no means entirely bare.</p>

<p>As soon as these streams reach ground that it is
possible to level into terraces, they are used for
irrigation, and become the stalks of minute
<i>mazra’s</i>. Then come long hill villages with
orchard trees and walnuts; and lastly, if there is
any water left at the real mountain base, there will
be a round irrigated patch of rather larger extent
on the edge of the plain.</p>

<p>In the middle of the plains water may be found
about sixty yards beneath the surface, a depth
from which it may be drawn through wells for
drinking purposes, but not in large quantities for
irrigation. Consequently, if the snow torrents
were the only source of water supply, the centres
of the Persian plains would be uninhabitable; for
in districts like that of Yezd the rainfall is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
trifling that nine or ten not over large falls of rain
or snow in the twelve months constitute a wet
year. But water that is found at sixty, or even a
hundred, yards down at the base of the hills is by
no means useless. From this point to the centre
of the plain there is a considerable, though very
gradual declivity. So when the original shaft has
been sunk, and water has been found, perhaps at
three hundred feet below the surface, a long line of
similar shafts are sunk towards the centre of the
desert, at distances varying from twenty to forty
yards, the line sometimes stretching for more
than thirty miles, until a point of desert has been
reached that lies as deep down as the original
water-level. Then all the shafts are connected at
the bottom by burrows, just big enough to afford
passage to a man; the water is let in, and appears
in an open ditch in the centre of the desert. Of
course conveyance of water by these <i>qan’āts</i> as
they are called, which are often thirty or forty
miles long, is by no means inexpensive, so as a rule
the water is used immediately it can be brought to
the surface. Consequently we find all through
the barren Persian plains two strange phenomena:
little cultivations, fed by artificial channels,
standing all by themselves, leagues away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
anywhere, in the middle of a desolate and waterless
expanse; and large towns such as Yezd,
situated far away from any natural water supply,
in the barest spot to be found in all the desert,
the central hollow where the drifting sands
have collected and covered over even the
faintest vestige of vegetable life.</p>

<p class="caption">HUJJATABAD, THE FIRST STAGE FROM YEZD.</p>
<p class="caption">Sandy desert, with qan’at pits in foreground.</p>
</div>

<p>The typical Persian plain is very long,
appearing to be comparatively narrow, and
certainly flat beyond conception. The plains
through which one approaches Yezd from Kashan
or Kirman are probably on the average about
sixty miles broad. But the huge barren mountains,
lying in long jagged ranges to the right and
left, show with such plainness of detail from
every point, that the traveller unused to the
clear atmosphere of the East can hardly credit
the full size and distance. Mountains, plains,
foreground, and far perspective, everything, in
the Yezd district at any rate, is one neutral tint
of brown, except for the snow lying on the rocks
of the mountain-top, the long flakes of salt
scattered here and there about the plain, or the
continual moving mirage. Even at sunrise and
sunset, when the sky and distant hills put on a
colouring of glorious brilliancy, there is an utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
absence of those soft tones in the foreground
which can only be given by sunlight in a humid
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Near Yezd there rise into sight brown villages,
excrescences of the same material as that on
which they stand, isolated separate objects with
sharp definite bounds. The scanty, hedgeless
crops that surround them, usually arranged in
oblong patches like small allotments, seldom show
until the traveller is quite near; the few trees
are wretchedly poor in size and colour, and the
walls and buildings are simply mud, of which
three parts are in ruins.</p>

<p>After a few of these villages we come to Yezd
itself, equally isolated from everything, and in
other respects very much the same as the villages.
However, as we approach the town by most of
the main roads, there are no fields and no trees
at all. Also there are sticking out from the
town a lot of high square air-shafts, looking like
short factory chimneys. Yezd, like the villages,
is brown, but there are a few patches of white.
There are one or two very faintly tiled minarets
and a newer-looking green dome; but these things
are not sufficiently striking to modify the general
brown effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we are among the <i>bāghs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A <i>bāgh</i> is
an enclosure, generally oblong, consisting of mud
walls twelve feet high, surrounding a planted area.
Very often a <i>bagh</i> contains nothing but fields
of farm crops. The better class <i>baghs</i>, belonging
to the richer Persians, have in the centre a kind
of summer dwelling-house with plenty of porticos,
built on a very open-air pattern. Such <i>baghs</i>
are well stocked with fruit trees and rose bushes;
there may also be a few small elms, or short
poplars, or perhaps some cypresses. There are
not many flowers. Here, too, most of the area
is given up to farm crops. Everything is laid
out after the plan of a Dutch garden, but without
the turf and thick foliage, and also without the
extreme trimness that we connect with such places.
In the better gardens there is always a small
gutter of running water, and generally an artificial
tank with a stone border. This is the part of
the <i>bagh</i> most highly prized by the natives. In
Persia a small artificial channel with a stream
of water about two feet across seems to give
that air of distinction to a house which we expect
from a well-kept lawn with good flower-beds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
From the road nothing can be seen of all this
greenery except the tops of the highest trees.
In Yezd indeed only the <i>baghs</i> that lie some
way out up the course of the <i>qan’ats</i> show as
much as this. Just round the town nothing is
to be seen but the bare walls and the gateways
of the gardens. The gateways have some brickwork
about them, and are sometimes partially
whitened. They stand back from the road. The
tops of the mud walls are generally in bad repair,
and here and there we come across a jagged
hole that has been made as a short cut into
the garden by the gardener. In such cases the
pieces of mud and sun-dried bricks, when they
have been taken out, lie in the street. Where
the surface of the thoroughfare has not been taken
up for bricks, which by the way are left to bake
in the sun in the middle of the road, it is generally
used for drying manure that has been kneaded
with a modicum of earth. The dyers also use
the street for hanging up their cloths to dry,
and also for arranging their skeins of silk, which
they twist round wooden pegs stuck into the
wall about forty yards apart. The road surface
is a little irregular, and occasionally it is made
more interesting by a shaft leading into a <i>qan’at</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
As we approach the houses proper the road
narrows, for it is only the natural lane between
enclosures, and the house enclosures, which from
the outside are exactly similar to the <i>baghs</i>, lie
closer together.</p>

<p>Occasionally, as we near the centre of the
town, we come across open squares with a small
mosque on the one side. The wall of the mosque
is dirty white, and there is a little black lettering
over the doorway, but very little tile or brick.
In the middle there may be a dilapidated octagon
with a flat top, about five feet high and six
across, built of mud covered with tiles rather
the worse for wear. Round such squares there
are generally arched recesses, filled in at the
bottom, so as to make a ledge three feet from
the ground. The bazaars are just the old narrow
lanes, covered by a succession of mud domes
forming a continuous but untidy roof. The goods
are displayed on tiers of mud ledges, and there
is a mud room behind. Quantities of the wares
are mud. Firepans, barrels for grain, several
kinds of toys, bread receptacles, and some other
household implements are simply clay, moulded
into a rough form, and dried in the sun. Water-bottles,
various kinds of pitchers, children’s money-boxes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and hookah-bowls are baked with fire, but
without the slightest glaze. The baker’s ovens
are made of mud, down to the very doors. Many
of the Yezdis even eat mud, and develop an
unwholesome muddy complexion.</p>

<p>The cleverness of the Yezdi in manipulating
mud is beyond belief. Sometimes you may see
men in the streets making barrels for storing
grain. First of all a smooth round slab of mud
about an inch and a half thick, is moulded on the
ground. Then another piece of mud is kneaded
into a long sausage, and placed in a hoop upon
the edge of the slab. Sausage after sausage is
added hoopwise, one on the top of the other,
until a height of about four feet has been reached.
Each hoop, as it is laid in position, is worked with
the hand into smooth connection with the hoop
below, and when the barrel is completed there is
not the least vestige of a join. The whole is done
without wheel or machinery of any kind. A mud
lid is added which is soldered on with mud when
the barrel is filled.</p>

<p>I have hardly yet succeeded in giving any
adequate impression of the untidiness of the
streets. The central courtyard of the house is
generally a fair-sized garden. For reasons connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with the water supply the inhabitants of
the houses are continually altering the level of
these places, and large quantities of earth are
emptied into the street or carried out of it every
day as occasion may arise. All along the sides of
the streets there are shallow holes for rubbish
heaps; here and there there are cesspools; and yet
with all this the streets are so well scavenged by
dogs and children that, except in the Jewish
quarter, the thoroughfare is comparatively clean,
while, thanks to the powerful sun and the absolute
absence of moisture in the atmosphere, almost the
only obtrusive smells from one end of the town
to the other are those that hang round the public
baths and the places used by the dyers.</p>

<p>Let us now enter one of the doorways that
leads into a better class house. We find ourselves
first of all in a round or octagonal porch, covered
by a small dome, which is generally pierced in the
centre to admit light. From this porch we go
through a passage into one of the court-yards. In
a good house there are two, or even three court-yards.
The whole family live in the better compound,
and the men receive their visitors in the
smaller one. Though this rule is not without
exception, the better class women in Yezd do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
not seem to have much to complain of in the
matter of housing.</p>

<p>In the court-yard there will be found an open
tank and some flower-beds; the rest is generally
paved. The flower-beds are below the level of
the pavement, and are irrigated from the tank.
Watering-pots are used for watering the pavement
only. Sometimes the whole garden is sunk to the
level of the cellar floor, so as to get nearer to the
<i>qan’at</i>. The house itself consists of two sets of
buildings, chiefly one story, with perhaps one or
two upstairs rooms. The upper rooms, however, do
not really form a separate story, but are built over
the lowest of the ground-floor rooms, so as to bring
the roof more or less to one level. The roofs are
generally paved with flat bricks of the shape of tiles,
and are surrounded by a low mud wall, so as to
form a more or less secluded and cool place, where
the family may sleep in summer. Perhaps a dome
may partially project above the level of the rest
of the roof. Also there is the inevitable <i>bād-gīr</i>,
or square air-shaft, running down to the back of
the big summer portico, or <i>tālār</i>, and furnished at
the top with long slits on all four sides to catch
any air that may be moving. This <i>talar</i> is the
principal room on the summer side, which faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
north. It is often built in the form of a cross
with very stumpy arms, or rather of an oblong
with the corners so taken off as to render it
slightly cruciform. The long side of the oblong
faces the court-yard, and has no wall at all, but
there is a curtain of tent-cloth that moves up
and down on pulleys. To the right and left of
this sun-blind are short walled-off passages, which
are used as entrances. Corresponding to the projecting
front part between the passages there is
at the back a recess under the <i>bad-gir</i>, completing
the cruciform design. The roof is arched into a
high dome. The whole <i>talar</i> is raised three feet
above the level of the garden, so as to give room
for a two-foot upright grating, which is the window
of the cellar room underneath. For five months
in the year these are the only habitable rooms in
a Persian house; and they are both furnished as
living-rooms. The rooms on either side of the
<i>talar</i> are so like the winter rooms that it is unnecessary
to describe them separately.</p>

<p>The whole structure of the place is quite
different from that of an English building.
Except for enclosing a rough garden the Persian
builder hardly ever makes a blank wall. Sometimes
the walls of the compound, generally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
walls of stables and outhouses, but always the
sides of rooms, passages, and porticos consist of
a series of arches more or less carefully moulded.
In the house, unless they are intended for doors,
windows, or cupboards, these arched recesses are
filled in to a height of three feet; so that round
every Persian room there is a series of ledges,
called <i>tāqchas</i>, about the size of a small mantelpiece,
generally a span deep, but sometimes very
much deeper, and running in instead of running
out. If the height of the room will allow it, there
is a line of straight moulding above these arches,
and above that a second row, usually much shorter
than the lower ones. Above that comes a second
series of lines of straight moulding, shelving into
the arch of the roof, for the ceilings are always
constructed on the arch principle, although they
are sometimes flattened on the top when it is
intended to build an upper room. These arches
are built of brick and mud only, without any wood
or wooden foundation; and indeed no wood is used
in a Yezd house at all, except for doors and
windows.</p>

<p>You will find three styles of wall in Persian
houses. Sometimes the rough mud is coated over
with a smoother surface, either clay and chopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
straw, or clay and sand, and the brown colour is
left unchanged. In fairly good houses this style
is often thought good enough for the summer
portico. Very often the angles of the mouldings
are pointed with white gypsum, and when ornamental
designs in the same fashion are added,
the effect is exceedingly pretty. But generally
the living rooms in a Persian house are entirely
whitened with gypsum, and a moulded design,
about an eighth of an inch thick, is made in the
centre of the ceiling. These complicated and
accurate geometrical designs are produced by the
natives with no better tools than a chisel and a
bit of string. The formation of the arches and
straight mouldings without instruments is equally
wonderful, but though the appearance is
geometrical two arches never exactly correspond
with one another if one comes to measure. Still
the construction of a Persian room, perhaps with
a large dome, without any better materials than
clay, gypsum, and a small modicum of baked
brick, without any scaffolding or wooden basis,
and with the help of none but the very simplest
tools, is a thing that may be accounted one
of the most extraordinary marvels of the
East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>As in the summer, so in the winter side, the
best room is generally in the centre. The better
rooms are almost invariably approached from the
side and not from the front, being separated from
one another by passages that run to the whole
depth of the buildings. This enables the entire
frontage of the room to be given up to windows.
Generally some of the rooms have a large cupboard
room at the back, which is frequently used
for sleeping in. As the floor of the house is three
feet above the level of the compound, the passages
between the rooms are furnished with steps, but
they have no doors. Consequently, to shift one’s
quarters in such a house necessitates going into
the open air. The smaller rooms are generally
approached from the front, and in this case they
sometimes have an <i>aivān</i>, or mud verandah. The
winter rooms always take up the north end of the
compound, but are often built along the east or
west side as well.</p>

<p>Rooms are generally named by the number of
their windows, which is usually three or five. A
good five-windowed room will have a frontage of
five arches filled in with French windows. The
semi-circular fanlight consists of pieces of
coloured glass fixed together in a wooden lattice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The lattice at a distance resembles fret-work,
but is really elaborately pieced together. Some
of the older windows contain exceedingly fine
work, but even when it is well done it is not
very durable, and nowadays they can only do
very rough work. Some of the work that is forty
or fifty years old is marvellous, but could not be
done at the present time for love or money. The
French window itself consists of two doors which
are supposed to meet in the middle. There are
no hinges, but each door has a wooden foot which
turns in a mud socket. The arrangement of the
coloured glasses which forms the panes is extremely
artistic. The same sort of wooden lattice is used,
but the pattern is rather larger than the pattern
of the fanlight. As may be supposed, it is
extremely difficult to keep these windows clean,
for the panes, besides being very minute, are
simply caught into grooves in the wood; and, as
the work is done without any great accuracy,
they very seldom fit. The doors are made after
the same design as the windows, but they have
wooden panels. They are often surmounted by
a glazed fanlight. The wood of the doors and
windows is covered with a yellowish-brown paint,
and warps very badly, as it is used in an unseasoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
state. Our cat could generally get in
through a bolted door.</p>

<p>Of course there is no form of door fastening
which can be used from both sides, and in this
way as in others a Persian house is distinctly inconvenient.
Still the style of building when fresh
is very pretty. These masses of French windows
with their coloured panes artistically arranged,
the lines of white arches all along the sides, and
the high-arched ceiling with its curious mouldings
give the room an ecclesiastical appearance. At
the back of the room there is not infrequently
a corresponding line of door-windows, leading to
one of those cupboard-rooms which I have
before mentioned. This arrangement increases
the regularity of the general design.</p>

<p>Before passing on to describe the furniture
I must mention that there is one other totally
different style of window, which lifts up in a
sash, without pulleys, and is supported when
open by metal stays. Also it is very common
to find wooden lattices unglazed. Paper or
calico is pasted over these in the winter.</p>

<p>There are one or two other forms of ornamentation
that are not uncommon. Perhaps a
line of painting, quaint but distinctly artistic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
may run round the room just below the <i>taqchas</i>,
giving the effect of a dado. Sometimes the roof
is much more elaborately moulded, and is
spangled with little bits of looking-glass; when
this is not overdone the effect is pleasing. It is
not uncommon to find very poor looking-glasses,
about twelve by six inches, let into the walls.
There are in almost every room rings attached
to staples, which are intended to support the
baby’s hammock. Fireplaces are a European
importation, but they are generally to be found
in at least one room of the better class houses.
They are almost always narrow, and comparatively
high, so as to conform to the arch design, and
they are made in the wall without any metal.
The metal fittings of the room, such as hammock-rings,
staples, and door and window latches, are
made of whitened iron curiously engraved; and
nails of the same material with very large heads,
from one inch to three or four inches across, are
used freely by the Persians for ornamenting
woodwork.</p>

<p>The movable furniture of a Persian room is
very simple. Curtains are not used very freely,
and those that are used are rather scanty.
Generally they are hung up by the corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
without any string. In the men’s apartments
they are used more for doors than for windows.
The favourite pattern is a very crude green or
red with a large lozenge in the middle, like the
design on a watered silk.</p>

<p>The only really valuable things in a Persian
room are the carpets. In some cases these are
laid right up to the walls, and a piece of drugget
something less than a yard wide is also laid along
the walls, usually on three sides of the room.
In other cases there is a border of very thick
clumsy felts arranged round the carpet which
occupies the centre of the floor. The felts are
self-coloured, with a small amount of stamped
pattern. They have not got cut edges, but are
made in one piece, consequently the shape is very
inaccurate. They cost nearly as much as good
carpets, and are often protected with druggets in
the same way. In the place of honour, furthest
from the door, is a mattress stuffed with cotton,
covered with some sort of chintz or cretonne,
and furnished with one or two very large round
bolsters. In the winter there is also occasionally
a <i>kursī</i> in evidence, but they are less common
in Yezd than in other Persian towns. The <i>kursi</i> is
a rough stool, about as high as a milking-stool, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
about eighteen inches square, completely covered
with cotton quilts and rugs, which trail on the
ground on every side. Beneath this an iron
brazier of lighted charcoal is placed, and the
family tuck their legs underneath the wraps, and
squat round the <i>kursi</i> on the floor. This, however,
is not generally kept in the room except in
the coldest weeks. During the remaining seasons
the brazier is often brought in on a large copper
tray, either for heating the room, or for keeping
the teapot warm and for opium smoking. All
copper and iron utensils in Persia, such as these
trays and braziers, are carefully tinned.</p>

<p>Tables in Yezd are made in the roughest
fashion, but the legs are nicely turned, the Yezd
carpenters being greatly inferior to the turners,
who are entirely distinct from them, and who
produce very good work with the simplest class
of hand-lathe worked with a bow. The carpenter,
on the other hand, is incapable of putting up a
shelf straight. He never dovetails, and he
disguises the inaccuracy of his joints with plentiful
deposits of clay.</p>

<p>Many of the Yezdis use little tables about three
feet by two, and standing about twelve inches high.
These are used only for tea-things. But tea is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
generally made by an inferior, standing at a tall
table in the corner of the room. These tables
are rather larger, not less than four feet by two.
They stand as high as an English sideboard, and
have a rough border of curved or dog-tooth pattern
falling down from the slab, so that they very
much suggest a rough dressing-table. They
are often brought in and out of the rooms
as they are wanted. People who wish to be
thoroughly European in their manners sometimes
have a larger table of the same kind permanently
in the room, surrounded by a few bentwood
chairs, which are brought up from Bombay, or
folding-chairs with cane seats, which I think they
bring from Isfahān, and about which the less
said the better. Such a table is always covered
by a white cloth, the most fashionable variety
being a Turkey bath-towel.</p>

<p>These chairs and larger tables are no real
part of Persian plenishing, while the tea-tables
are being continually carried backwards and
forwards, and are not necessary to the equipment
of the room. Consequently the room does
not present a very filled appearance. The few
utensils which it contains, other than those
mentioned, are placed upon the <i>taqchas</i>. On one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of these <i>taqchas</i> may be seen a pair of <i>lālas</i>.
The <i>lala</i> is a spring candlestick with a globe,
and is, I believe, made in Europe. The candles
are also imported. All lights in Persia have to
be carefully protected from the wind, as the
house is not a continuous building, but a series
of outhouses. On another <i>taqcha</i> will be found
a lamp, also of European manufacture. Persian
lamps, which are simply saucers of native vegetable
oil with a floating wick, are used freely about
the house when a strong light is not required,
but they have the disadvantage of blackening
the gypsum of the walls. With regard to the
imported lamps it is a curious thing that, although
the lamps used are of the cheapest variety, with
stems and reservoirs of blue or white glass, lamps
with short stems, which might be brought into
the country at an infinitely less cost, do not seem
to have come into fashion. On a third <i>taqcha</i>
is sure to be found a specimen of the Persian
hookah, or <i>qaliān</i>. This is a most elaborate
pipe, and is both made and bought in sections.
The large bowls, however, when they are made
of glass, are, I believe, imported; also some of
the china heads.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will find on the <i>taqchas</i> a pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of European vases. In Yezd the pattern is almost
always that of the hand rising up from a stand
and grasping a tapered vessel. Sometimes also
you will find cheap Continental oleographs,
generally ladies’ heads. These are bought by
the pair, and you will find two copies of the
same picture standing side by side. Another
European import to which the Yezdis are much
attached is a looking-glass. These are of the
oblong shape, with varnished or gilt frames.
Perhaps also one will see on the <i>taqchas</i> a covered
glass vessel with a long spout, containing rose-water.</p>

<p>In the women’s rooms there is occasionally a
large wooden trunk for clothes, covered with
gold and silver paper, and of a very clumsy design.
The <i>taqchas</i> may be covered with plush cloths,
and this is sometimes the case in the men’s
apartments. The women are also fond of highly
ornamented trinket boxes.</p>

house, and the bottom of the picture is the level of the compound.
The room underneath is a living room, and is lighted by the grating
under the <i>talar</i>. It is only used in the heat of the day. The door
to the cellar staircase is seen on the right of the picture. The
passage is the approach to the <i>talar</i> itself.</p>
<p class="caption">The three men are sitting in the ordinary Persian way round a
tray of sweets. The Yezd sweets are remarkably good and have no
coarse flavour. They eat them as we do cakes, but in rather larger
quantities. This <i>talar</i> is a small one. The larger ones are generally
cruciform in shape. It has no <i>bad-gir</i> (air-shaft) or front curtain.</p>
</div>

<p>The better class Yezd houses are exceedingly
clean, and so on the whole are the people who
live in them. In this Yezd is distinctly superior
to some other Persian towns. The houses of
the rather poorer classes in Yezd are dirtier, but
they would compare favourably with those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a corresponding class in many parts of Europe.
The very poor class are crowded together, many
families to one house, and live in a condition of
filth as great as the dry atmosphere will permit.
You must remember that the native never removes
his clothes for the night; indeed he only removes
his clothes or washes his body when he goes to
the public bath. The fee for admission is a mere
trifle, but people do not go to the bath unless
they have an absolutely clean set of clothes to
change into when they have bathed. A few of
the poor people take off their clothes on arriving
at the bath and wash them, staying in the bath
until they are dry enough to put on again. This,
however, is exceptional, and generally speaking
the difference in the standard of cleanliness
accepted by the richer and poorer Yezdis is
very large.</p>

<p>Houses that are not very new are always
more or less tumble-down. The mud ceilings
crack very easily, and the white gypsum flakes
off at the slightest touch. The more essential
parts of the structure are equally undurable. But
you must remember that no Yezdi wants his
house to last for ever. When the house is first
of all built, a large chamber is made below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
surface to receive the drainage, and the size of
this is determined by the length of time the
owner wishes his house to last, which is generally
forty to fifty years. When the chamber is full,
the rich occupants move to another house, and
the house gradually falls to pieces. To the Yezdi
an old house means a bad house, and this idea
is so deeply rooted, that even in his <i>bagh</i> he
seems to prefer young trees to those which have
attained their full size. The idea of a residence
which bears the marks of natural growth, and is
not simply artificial, has never entered into the
Yezdi’s mind; and the absence of this to us
familiar idea, has to be reckoned with in dealing
with his character. Also it must be remembered
that two-thirds of a Persian town, and three-quarters
of a Persian village, is from various
causes invariably in ruins. I suppose that in
an English climate the best-built Yezd dwelling
houses would remain standing for about a fortnight.
In spite of their palatial design they are really
nothing but mud huts, and when you live in
them, or rather about them, for you are in the
open air as often as you are inside, you learn
their imperfections to your cost. Nobody can
realise the immense amount of damage that can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
be done in a town like Yezd by a really wet
day. Some while ago we had twenty-four hours
of rain, which destroyed, I believe, about a couple
of hundred roofs, and, what is worse, caused the
older <i>qan’at</i> pits to fall in, blocking the water
supply in some parts of the town for three months.
Is there any other town in the world where a
little extra rain causes a three months’ drought?
There is a story in Tehran about a Dutch
Ambassador, who was so afraid of the roof falling
down that in wet weather he invariably slept
under the table. However he was a very tall
man, and, when the catastrophe happened, he
got his foot crushed.</p>

<p>Still the summer buildings in a Yezd house
are really not bad. Generally speaking, the
Persian builds well for heat and badly for cold.
Yet the short Yezdi winter is a very severe one;
and we, who are accustomed to a longer cold
season, are astonished to see the philosophic way
in which the Yezdi sets himself to endure the
cold while it lasts, without taking any particular
precautions to defend himself from it. The long
window-front is a mass of spaces and cracks.
Even when panes are not missing, daylight is
frequently to be seen between the glass and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
lattice, between the window and its frame, and
sometimes between the frame and the wall. This
of course is not including the crack between the
two doors, which is often half an inch wide.
Remember that every door in the house is a
front door, leading into the open air, and you
will get some idea of the provision made against
the winter cold. The fact is that the Persian only
understands two kinds of winter requirements, that
of the hard living working-man who demands
only the simplest shelter against the cold, and
that of the man who on cold days can devote
himself to keeping warm with a <i>kursi</i> in an inner
apartment. A man who wants to do his work
comfortably in any sort of weather is entirely
beyond his calculation. On the few days when
snow falls the merchants’ offices are practically
deserted, and no one but the smaller tradesmen
and artisans goes to the bazaars.</p>

<p>The house, as I have said, is really built for a
protection against heat. When I first went
to Yezd I was surprised to find how
tremendously the natives were affected by the hot
weather. The native is certainly less affected than
the European by the direct rays of the sun; but
although something in the climate seems to tell on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Europeans after two or three years’ residence, I
would back a fairly strong Englishman, furnished
with a sun-helmet, against the average town Yezdi,
to get through a piece of work on a hot day, or to
keep up continuous hard work for a season or two.
Consequently every Yezdi who can afford it tries
to get away from town for at least two months of
the year. The hill villages, which the Persians
call <i>yailāq</i>, or summer quarters, lie about thirty
miles away from the town. Every well-to-do
Persian has a house in one or other of these
villages, and there is a fashion about them, some
being resorts chiefly patronised by the artisans,
and some by the big merchants.</p>

<p>As most of the richer Persians have more than
one house in the villages, Europeans generally have
no great difficulty in hiring a place to stay at. The
houses are left during the winter in charge of a
villager, who uses the lower rooms only, the upper
ones being then uninhabitable from the intense
cold. Indeed the cold is so great that we were told
that one winter the animals had been dying of thirst,
as the water was frozen beyond the possibility of
breaking the ice, and they had not fuel enough to
melt it. The whole building is much rougher than
the town house, though the roofs have to be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
more carefully. The villages are very small and
isolated, and the winter population is quite trifling.
There is in these villages a little arable land, but
the people depend chiefly on root-crops, nuts, and
dried fruit for their winter stores, and on the
produce of the sheep and goats. The animals are
tended in summer by the children. The little
boys spend most of their time up the walnut trees,
throwing down leaves for them to eat, while the
little ragged shepherdesses carry a twelve-foot staff
for whacking the walnut trees, when they do not
climb them in the same way as their brothers.</p>

<p>Those who go to the villages in the summer
take with them everything they need in the way
of carpets, furniture, and cooking utensils, also
all groceries, and even wheat and charcoal; for
the commonest things of this kind are often
absolutely unprocurable. A rich Persian has
stores frequently sent to him from Yezd during his
stay. Even in Yezd some necessary store or other
is almost always running short, so that something
is generally at famine prices. This, of course, is
due to the great isolation of the town. But in the
villages it is intensified. Sometimes there will be
no meat, at another time hardly any bread, and
some years ago we found it almost impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
procure milk, and were told by our Persian friends
that they had the same difficulty. This eighteen-hour
journey, with all the paraphernalia of the
home, is the average Yezdi’s only experience of
foreign travel; and for this reason I have thought
it necessary to give some account of what he sees
and finds.</p>

<p>I have now done my best to describe in detail
almost the whole of the Yezdi’s surroundings, the
furniture of his room, the pattern of his house, the
streets of his town, and the vast deserts by which
he is isolated from the world. When he gets up
in the morning, he finds himself in a room
practically containing nothing but a carpet, the
walls and ceiling an expanse of white gypsum, and
the <i>taqchas</i> provided with solitary objects upon
which his eye can rest in turn without the slightest
diversion to anything else. There is no confusion,
but at the same time there is no arrangement. In
such a room, with such furniture, the necessity for
arrangement never occurs to him. He goes out
into his court-yard; certainly there are flower-beds,
but they are not cut like English flower-beds
in the middle of necessarily existing growth and
greenery. The shape of the beds and the nature
of their contents has not been chosen with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
slightest view to their artistic surroundings; they
are simply artificial constructions in a waste of
pavement which itself conceals the desert which
stands to the Persian in the place of the natural
world. Inside the beds each plant grows its own
life, by itself, untouched by its neighbour, and the
eye unconsciously fixes itself upon it as on an
isolated unit. The Yezdi leaves his house and
passes through an absolutely dry and scentless
atmosphere along streets which present variety
only in the matter of form. He goes for a journey
across the desert plains; to the right there is only
one object to be seen, a range of distant
mountains, with a slight variety of jags along the
top; to the left there is a similar range. Every
now and again he comes across a shrub which
attracts his eye by its hermit existence. Behind
him is the solitary city; every six miles, while he
is in the neighbourhood of the town, there is an
equally solitary village, or perhaps a water-cistern
with a domed roof; for league after league he can
see in front of him his solitary <i>manzil</i>, where he
intends to stay the night. Even when he goes to
the villages this sparseness of life and circumstance
is scarcely modified. Can you be surprised if this
hourly contemplation of isolated units produces a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
mind which it is impossible for the tangle-reared
European ever to fully understand? Can you be
surprised if an intellect is produced accustomed to
almost unbelievable concentration upon single
and solitary ideas, but almost unreachable by
minds that are accustomed to complicated trains
of thought, to careful evasions of contradictions,
and to systematic arrangements of their intellectual
knowledge?</p>

<p>The population of Yezd can only be guessed
at, but probably that of the town proper is
between thirty and forty thousand, and that of
the town and surrounding villages between fifty and
sixty thousand. This little community is insular
beyond the insularity of islands. Within two
hundred miles there are three sizable cities,
Shīrāz, Kirmān, and Isfahān, of which Isfahan is
slightly the nearest. When you send a letter to
Isfahan from Yezd, if your friend writes by return
of post you may get back your answer in a month;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
although a runner, taking the slightly shorter road
by the mountains, could go and return within the
week. Travelling in the ordinary way the journey
takes eight days there, and eight back.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that within the last two years
they have got rid of the native telegraph line.
During my journey up six years ago this contrivance
was a source of never-failing interest and
surprise to me. First of all there were the poles.
They were rough sticks, exactly like what a
washerwoman in England uses for propping up
her clothes-line: I suppose, taking the good line
with the bad, there was on the average about one
insulator to every three poles; this is without
counting the insulators which were hung midway
between the poles, apparently by way of ornament.
The wire itself was at different levels: in a good
many places it lay on the ground, but at others it
crossed the road about the level of a horseman’s
chin. One day in Yezd one of the European
residents wanted to send a telegram, and sent to
the telegraph office to ask when the line would be
up. They sent back a very polite message to say
that the trouble was not that the line was down;
it was always down: the difficulty was that a
camel had stepped upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course they do repair the line: we saw a
man repairing it. He had a forked stick about
half the length of one of the poles on which the
line was hung. With this he caught the wire and
hitched it on to the nearest fork of the telegraph
pole, a procedure which had at any rate the advantage
of economy. I think I may say that telegrams
by this line never went faster than the post goes in
England. The slightest fall of snow or any other
similar cause cut the communications altogether,
sometimes for a fortnight; and, on similar lines
that were a little longer, if you sent a telegram to
your destination while you yourself were on a
journey, it was a quite common occurrence for the
telegraph master at the next town to ask you to
carry it yourself as the quickest way of hastening
its arrival.</p>

<p>Such an apparatus as this could hardly be
expected to prove a great connecting influence.
As a matter of fact, the Yezdi regards the
Isfahani as a foreigner. When I was leaving
Yezd I remember the sensation amongst my
servants when they heard that my successor, who
was going to take on most of them, wanted to
bring an Isfahani butler. Yezdis hardly recognise
the bond of a common country at all. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
three connecting links which appeal to them; the
link of a common religion; the link of a common
family or business, for the family tie is of a
character that includes the relation between
employé and employer; and lastly, the link of the
common town.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The bond of fellow-townsmanship
is perhaps not considered a very close one,
but for all that it is a real link. However, if you
were to suggest to a Yezdi that he ought to have
something in common with a Bushīrī, irrespective
of the question of religion, simply because they
both paid taxes to a common king, I very much
doubt whether he would understand what you
meant, and, if he did, I am quite sure that he
would think that you were either joking or a
lunatic.</p>

<p>In the vocabulary of the common people it is
difficult to find an intelligible word for <i>country</i>.
There is a word for <i>empire</i>, but the natural equivalent
in the Persian mind to our expression <i>country</i>,
meaning fatherland, is <i>shahr</i>, which denotes a town,
or <i>vatan</i>, which is the home-district, and is used in
very much the same way. “What is your town?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
is the Persian’s way of saying, “Where do you
come from?” and although he has been taught to
call an Englishman <i>Inglīs</i>, he almost invariably
calls England <i>Landan</i>; indeed it is this which we
put as an address on all our English letters.</p>

<p>The Yezdi’s ideas on the regions beyond his
very narrow horizon are distinctly confused. If
you begin to talk to him about other places, you
are met not by mere ignorance of geography,
but by a conception of the surface of the earth
that is ludicrously impossible. It is difficult for
a European to conceive of a number of towns
and villages, containing several millions of people,
bedded out over an enormous desert area considerably
larger than the whole of France. It is
equally difficult for the Yezdi to conceive of a
natural and continuous land. Even those who
have travelled a little outside Yezd, and have
been obliged to modify slightly the Yezdi conception
of the universe, have built up their notions
of the world’s surface upon what seems to us a
most peculiar first idea; and they have in most
cases clung to far more of their original views
than we should believe possible.</p>

<p>The Yezdi’s idea of the town as the only
geographical and political unit is simply a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
generalisation from the circumstances of his own
city. Yezd is a solitary object rising abruptly
out of a vast desert that is about the nearest
thing to a vacuum which Nature has yet produced.
Then too, the methods by which the Shah retains
his half of the government of the country—I say
his half, for half of the real control of the people is
in the hands of the Mussulman clergy—is in some
points similar to the old Roman system of provincial
government. The local governor, and not
the supreme sovereign, is the real ruler, and he
rather than his people is responsible to the head
of the State. Of course he is only appointed for
a time, and is in constant expectation of recall.
Still, while he remains, his power is limited more
by the power of the Mohammedan mullās on the
one hand, and by the strength and number of
his subordinate officials and guards on the other,
and much less by the orders and authority that
he receives from Tehran. But it is true that the
Yezdi exaggerates the separateness of his town, for
he hardly recognises the actual limitations to the
Governor’s power made and enforced by the Shah.
Of course it is thoroughly understood that the
Governor only holds his office by the Shah’s
appointment; but it is very difficult for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Yezdi to realise that that appointment, while it
lasts, is to anything short of autocracy. So to him
the local Government is <i>the</i> Government, and the
local Governor the real ruler of his country, that is
to say of the district surrounding his town; and it
would puzzle him if you were to tell him that there
were people in this world, living together in one
sphere of government, who were not resident in
one town, or in the district that belonged to it.</p>

<p>It may be urged that I am speaking of the
uneducated and ignorant class, but there are
very few in a town like Yezd who are not
uneducated and ignorant, and even those who
have superadded a certain degree of knowledge,
have, in almost all cases, retained the majority of
their preconceptions. Persians are very slow in
seeing a contradiction; consequently, I believe
that this conception of the universe, which is
certainly accepted by the ordinary Yezdi, is
with small modifications very general even
among the slightly travelled or educated classes.
Nor should a student of the mental attitude of
a people ignore the curious ideas that are to be
found amongst the women. One who had moved
a great deal amongst the women of Yezd, assured
me that they were almost invariably under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
impression that the less familiar words occurring
in the Persian translation of the Scriptures were
English, and that it was a common thing for a
woman who was accustomed to the European
pronunciation of Persian, to be referred to as
knowing the language of the Ferangis. Such
people would, of course, fail to comprehend the
possibility of a linguistic barrier very much
greater than the somewhat considerable difference
of dialect which separates them from their
neighbours in Isfahan. That such a state of
mind would be equally possible amongst the
men I do not for a moment suppose, but if this
is the view of the women, one may be sure that
there is a view of the Ferangi stranger, more
or less approximating to it, amongst many of
the ignorant hobbledehoys and young fellows,
who contribute the largest share to the character
of a fanatical Persian crowd.</p>

<p>Now the people of Yezd are quite ready
after a due interval to extend the citizenship
to strangers from other towns, provided that
the newcomers intend to stay, and are ready to
enter into the life of the community. The Kāshīs
from Kāshān, the Shīrāzīs from Shīrāz, the Lārīs
from Lāristān, and the Rashtīs from Rasht, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
all well-known Yezd families, and are not by
any means regarded as foreigners. Also the
Yezd community includes persons of three or
four different religions. There are in the town
fourteen hundred Parsi houses, the inhabitants
of which are Zoroastrian. There is also a smaller
colony of Jews. The remainder are Mohammedans;
but a considerable number of these
belong to the Behāī sect, and are considered
rank heretics. The Parsis, though greatly
oppressed in the past, and still liable to some
disabilities, have of late years become wealthy
and prosperous. The Jews are in some ways
less restricted than the Parsis; but, as they are
still wretchedly poor, they are really much more
down-trodden. That religious bigotry still exists
among the Mussulmans in Yezd has only lately
been made perfectly plain by the ghastly massacre
of the Behāīs in the summer of 1903; but
Mohammedan bigotry in Persia is by no means
without limitations. It is spasmodic in its action,
nor does it entirely obliterate every other feeling.</p>

<p>A few years ago Yezd had the reputation of
being one of the most bigoted of the towns of
Persia. The presence of the Zoroastrian remnant,
who were subject to the grossest persecution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
served only to keep alive the fire of religious
hatred; and the community of Jews in a lesser
degree had the same effect. The stories of the
way in which the Parsis were bullied and persecuted
are interesting, as showing, amongst other
things, the intense childishness of the Persian
Mussulman. The atmosphere of the town seems
to have resembled, as indeed it still resembles,
that of a preparatory school for little boys. Up
to 1895 no Parsi was allowed to carry an umbrella.
Even during the time that I was in Yezd they
could not carry one in town. Up to 1895 there
was a strong prohibition upon eye-glasses and
spectacles; up to 1885 they were prevented from
wearing rings; their girdles had to be made of
rough canvas, but after 1885 any white material
was permitted. Up to 1896 the Parsis were
obliged to twist their turbans instead of folding
them. Up to about 1898 only brown, grey, and
yellow were allowed for the <i>qabā</i> or <i>arkhālūq</i>
(body garments), but after that all colours were
permitted, except blue, black, bright red, or green.
There was also a prohibition against white stockings,
and up to about 1880 the Parsis had to
wear a special kind of peculiarly hideous shoe
with a broad, turned-up toe. Up to 1885 they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
had to wear a torn cap. Up to about 1880 they
had to wear tight knickers, self-coloured, instead
of trousers. Up to 1891 all Zoroastrians had to
walk in town, and even in the desert they had
to dismount if they met a Mussulman of any
rank whatsoever. During the time that I was
in Yezd they were allowed to ride in the desert,
and only had to dismount if they met a big
Mussulman. There were other similar dress restrictions
too numerous and trifling to mention.
Then the houses of both the Parsis and the Jews,
with the surrounding walls, had to be built so
low that the top could be reached by a Mussulman
with his hand extended; they might, however,
dig down below the level of the road. The walls
had to be splashed with white round the door.
Double doors, the common form of Persian door,
were forbidden, also rooms containing three or
more windows. <i>Bad-girs</i> were still forbidden to
the Parsis while we were in Yezd, but in 1900
one of the bigger Parsi merchants gave a large
present to the Governor and to the chief <i>mujtahid</i>
(Mohammedan priest) to be allowed to build
one. Upper rooms were also forbidden.</p>

<p>Up to about 1860 Parsis could not engage in
trade. They used to hide things in their cellar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
rooms, and sell them secretly. They can now
trade in the caravanserais or hostelries, but not in
the bazaars, nor may they trade in linen drapery.
Up to 1870 they were not permitted to have a
school for their children.</p>

<p>The amount of the <i>jazīya</i>, or tax upon infidels,
differed according to the wealth of the individual
Parsi, but it was never less than two <i>tomāns</i>. A
<i>toman</i> is now worth about three shillings and eight
pence, but it used to be worth much more. Even
now, when money has much depreciated, it
represents a labourer’s wage for ten days. The
money had to be paid on the spot, when the
<i>farrash</i>, who was acting as collector, met the man.
The <i>farrash</i> was at liberty to do what he liked
when collecting <i>jaziya</i>. The man was not even
allowed to go home and fetch the money, but was
at once beaten until it was given. About 1865 a
<i>farrāsh</i> collecting this tax tied a man to a dog,
and gave a blow to each in turn.</p>

<p>About 1891 a <i>mujtahid</i> caught a Zoroastrian
merchant wearing white stockings in one of the
public squares of the town. He ordered the man
to be beaten and the stockings taken off.
About 1860 a man of seventy went to the bazaars
in white trousers of rough canvas. They hit him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
about a good deal, took off his trousers, and sent
him home with them under his arm. Sometimes
Parsis would be made to stand on one leg in a
<i>mujtahid’s</i> house until they consented to pay a
considerable sum of money. Occasionally, however,
the childish mockery that pervaded the
persecuting ordinances enabled the Zoroastrians to
evade the disabilities proposed. For instance, as
the Jews had to wear a patch on the <i>qaba</i>, or coat,
the <i>mujtahids</i> in about 1880 tried to make the
Parsis wear an obvious patch on the shirt.
Muhammad Hasan Khan was then Governor, and
Mulla Bahrām of Khurramshār, a Parsi, asked him
to arrange that his people should have three days’
respite to get the patches ready. During these
three days the Parsi women set to work, and made
a neat embroidered border round the neck and
opening of the shirt. This the Parsis exhibited as
the required patch; and as it was very obvious,
and was certainly an insertion, there was really
nothing more to be said. In Yezd a small score
like this counts for more than does a firman of the
Shah.</p>

<p>In the reign of the late Shah Nāsiru’d Dīn,
Mānukjī Limjī, a British Parsi from India, was for
a long while in Tehran as Parsi representative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Almost all the Parsi disabilities were withdrawn,
the <i>jaziya</i>, the clothes restrictions, the riding
restrictions, and those with regard to houses, but
the law of inheritance was not altered, according to
which a Parsi who has become a Mussulman takes
precedence of his Zoroastrian brothers and sisters.
The <i>jaziya</i> was actually remitted, and also some
of the restrictions as to houses, but the rest of the
firman was a dead letter.</p>

<p>In 1898 the present Shah, Muzaffaru’d Dīn,
gave a firman to Dīnyār, the present <i>Qalāntar</i> of
the Parsi <i>Anjuman</i>, or Committee, revoking all the
remaining Parsi disabilities, and also declaring it
unlawful to use fraud or deception in making
conversions of Parsis to Islam. This firman does
not appear to have had any effect at all.</p>

<p>About 1883, after the firman of Nāsiru’d Dīn
Shah had been promulgated, one of the Parsis,
Rustami Ardishīri Dīnyār, built in Kūcha Biyuk,
one of the villages near Yezd, a house with an
upper room, slightly above the height to which the
Parsis used to be limited. He heard that the
Mussulmans were going to kill him, so he fled by
night to Tehran. They killed another Parsi,
Tīrandāz, in mistake for him, but did not destroy
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>So the great difficulty was not to get the law
improved, but rather to get it enforced. When
Manukji was at Yezd, about 1870, two Parsis were
attacked by two Mussulmans outside the town, and
one was killed, the other being terribly wounded,
as they had tried to cut off his head. The
Governor brought the criminals to Yezd, but did
nothing to them. Manukji then got leave to take
them to Tehran. The Prime Minister, however,
told him that no Mussulman would be killed for a
<i>Zardūshtī</i>, or Zoroastrian, and that they would
only be bastinadoed. About this time Manukji
enquired whether it was true that the blood-price
of a <i>Zardushti</i> was to be seven <i>tomans</i>. He got
back the official reply that it was to be a little
over.</p>

<p>The Yezd Parsis have been helped considerably
by agents from Bombay, who are British subjects,
and of late years things have slightly improved.
About 1885, a <i>Seyid</i>, that is, a descendant of
Muhammad, killed a <i>Zardushti</i> woman in Yezd.
Ibrāhīm Qalīl Khān took him, and, by order of the
Zillu’s Sultān, Prince Governor of Isfahan, and elder
brother of the Shah, killed him before daybreak.
When the Mohammedan mullas heard of it in the
morning, they gave orders for a general slaughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the Parsis. Many of the Parsis were injured,
but none killed. Then in 1899 the Sahāmu’l
Mulk, at the commencement of his governorship of
Yezd, killed a Mussulman servant of the Mushīru’l
Mamālik for a criminal assault upon a Zoroastrian
woman. This man was not a Seyid, which made
the matter more simple. Just before, when the
Mushīru’l Mamālik was temporary Governor,
Isfandiār, the Parsi schoolmaster at Taft, one of
the large Yezd villages, and Salāmat, another
Parsi, were killed by two <i>lūtīs</i> (roughs) without
reason. One of these <i>lutis</i> was a Seyid. Both
were sent to Tehran, and a <i>mujtahid</i> went up with
them to ask for their release. The Shah ordered
the Seyid’s release, but the fate of the other is not
known. That the Seyid was not much intimidated
is certain, as in the August of 1901, when I was in
Taft, he used to wander about with other <i>lutis</i>
quite openly.</p>

<p>During the last nine or ten years the governors
in Yezd have been much stronger, and they have,
generally speaking, been friendly to the Parsis.
The Parsis are an industrious and intelligent
people, and they have become in Yezd a wealthy
community. Also there is an extremely wealthy
Parsi in Tehran, Arbāb Jamshīd, who is probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
more able to influence the Persian Government
in favour of his countrymen than are the Indian
Parsis from Bombay. Nowadays no governor who
wants to remain in Yezd can afford to leave the
Parsi community out of his calculations. The
real advance made by the Parsi colony seems to
date from the second term of government of the
Jalālu’d Daula, eldest son of the Zillu’s Sultān,
Governor of Isfahan. The Parsis themselves also
put down a great deal of the improvement in
their circumstances to the spread of the Behāī
faith, and certainly, although a semi-secret sect,
the Behāīs individually plead openly for a general
religious liberty and toleration. Naturally such
a movement has been of considerable assistance
to the Parsis. As an indication of the influence
of the Parsis, it is interesting to notice that during
the late Behāī massacres, immediately there was
talk of an attack on the Parsi quarter, the
Mussulman clergy applied themselves to suppressing
the movement.</p>

<p>Although the Jews are very much weaker and
poorer, they have their place in the social organisation
of the town, and the contempt in which
they are held does not prevent the Yezdis from
recognising their right to a kind of citizenship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Their religion of course is held in much greater
respect than that of the Parsis, for they are people
of the Book, and although the Persian Shiahs
granted the Zoroastrians a certain share in this
status, when they allowed them to continue in
the country on the same terms as Jews and
Christians, the ordinary Yezdi of to-day hesitates
considerably before he allows that Zoroaster was
in any sense a prophet.</p>

<p>I myself have met Mussulmans serving in a
menial capacity in Parsi houses; I have entertained
Parsis of standing and Mussulmans of
standing together on public occasions; and I
have no hesitation in saying that even the bigoted
Mussulman recognises the bond of common citizenship,
although it is certainly true that on most
occasions he prefers the bond of religion. Still,
a Persian’s religious feeling, even when it seems
to amount to fanatical bigotry, is generally so
connected with self-interest, that, when it is
disconnected from thoughts of profit, it is difficult
to know how much influence it will possess
with him.</p>

<p>It is certainly a fact that a year or two ago,
when an Isfahani Seyid came and preached in the
Yezd mosques against painted trays, Manchester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
cottons, bank-notes, and Bibles, the Yezdi Mussulmans
gave him the cold shoulder, and treated
him as a foreigner who had intruded himself
into their domestic concerns.</p>

<p>People were surprised at this happening in the
city which a few years before had been regarded
as one of the most fanatical in the whole of Persia.
As a matter of fact, the so-called fanaticism of
Yezd was two-thirds of it non-religious in character.
There was an element of turbulency, produced by
a series of weak governors; there was a real
religious element; and there was an element of
insularity, utterly unconnected with creed and
doctrine. In spite of the smallness of the
Christian colony, which even at present consists
of only eighteen Europeans, to which may be
added twenty-two Armenians (the households of
men in European employment), the people of
the town which is after all not large, had soon
become familiarised with this little settlement as
a Yezd institution. Then the insular spirit came
to be enlisted on the side of the Ferangis, and,
the turbulence produced by weak governorship
being eliminated, there was only the religious
difficulty left.</p>

<p>There have only been Europeans in Yezd for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
some twelve years. The early arrivals were a bank
manager and a merchant’s agent. The work of the
Church Missionary Society has been established
there for some six years, and the English telegraph
clerk has been there for about a year. Now all
the members of the colony have contributed
something to the life of the town, and all the
Europeans have worked together with marked
cordiality and harmony. Both of these things
have certainly had a great effect in hastening
the establishment of the colony in the town, and
in winning for it the support of the Yezdis’ insular
prejudices. The merchants are distinctly glad
of the bank, and of the resident agent from a
responsible Manchester firm. The people have
learnt to value the Medical Mission; and the
schools, though they appeal to a smaller class,
appeal equally strongly.</p>

<p>Even the directly spiritual work of a Mission
is granted an established position in the town by
the natives, if it is partially in connection with
the Christian community. Having granted a
community right of residence no Mohammedan
would deny them the right of religious observance.
Indeed this would be expected to exist as a
matter of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite true that Christian missions in
Persia do not possess the treaty right to make
converts from Mohammedanism. At the same
time, it must be remembered that Persians are
much more inclined to regard custom than law,
nor are they used to the accurate observance of
a fine distinction. All that can be said is that,
at present, the right of a Christian missionary to
baptize a Mussulman is in Yezd by no means
established, but that his right to live and work
and preach in the town as, primarily, the <i>mujtahid</i>
of the Ferangis, and secondarily, an accepted
Yezd teacher, is practically recognised by all.
This point seems to have been arrived at chiefly
through the acceptance of the entire European
colony as unitedly Christian and as a real part
of the town. Things that have helped us to
arrive at it have been the usefulness of the various
branches of work engaged in by the Europeans,
their general straightforwardness and honesty of
life, combined with their ready co-operation in
Christian effort; also the extreme acceptability
of the work of the medical missions, and the
linking of the clerical work with the life of the
town through the medium of schools. To these
must be added the smallness of Yezd, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
makes it impossible for the population consistently
to ignore or refuse to assimilate any important
band of workers that can maintain a residence
at all prolonged within its walls, and the insularity
which makes it impossible to refuse altogether
to champion what has become part of the town.
Also we must not forget the natural proneness
of the Shiah to religious speculation, and the
special ferment of religious ideas at present
prevailing throughout Persia. This, however, is
a matter that will be dealt with at length, later
on.</p>

<p>A curious incident occurred in Yezd not long
ago, that will perhaps serve to point to the
extraordinary way in which the Europeans have
in the mind of the Yezdi become an established
part of the town population, with rights and
privileges similar to those possessed by the native
section of the townsfolk. One of the European
residents had received a threatening letter from
a young Mussulman, whom he had dismissed
from his employ; and he had paid as little
attention to the matter as it deserved. It so
happened that the next day he came to our
house for a week’s visit, I being a clerical
missionary; and the dismissed servant then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
spread the report through the bazaars that his
master was frightened, and had taken sanctuary
with his <i>mujtahid</i>, this being a common Mussulman
custom when danger is apprehended either from
<i>lutis</i> or from the law. Not only was the report
believed, but one of the other Europeans was
obliged to give up a visit which he had intended
to pay us, as he was a business man, and his
credit might have been temporarily shaken.</p>

<p>A similar story is told by Canon Bruce, of an
experience in Isfahan. Though in some ways
more curious, it is, however, less convincing with
regard to the particular moral to which I am
attempting to point, since the Canon was then
working largely amongst the Armenian Christians
of Julfa, who are a considerable colony, and
subjects of the Shah. The Roman Catholic
Armenian priests, who were also working amongst
the Armenian Christians, got the chief Mussulman
<i>mujtahid</i> of Isfahan, of which Julfa is a suburb,
to summon Canon Bruce to his house. The
<i>mujtahid</i>, they said, was, after all, the chief
religious authority in the place, and Canon Bruce
was as much a heretic in Christianity as the Babis
were in Islam. This quaint summons was
actually issued, and the Mussulman <i>mujtahid</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
required Canon Bruce to defend himself against
the charge of preaching incorrect Christian
doctrine. This, of course, was an acceptance of
Canon Bruce’s position; but the acceptance of
the position of a clerical missionary in a place
where there were only eight or nine households
belonging to Christian races, European or
Armenian, is stranger still.</p>

<p>The possibility of such a thing ought, however,
to encourage us with regard to the future of
missionary work in isolated and apparently bigoted
Persian towns, and also to make missionaries
realise the immense value of the co-operation of
Christian residents, and the necessity of attending
fully to their spiritual needs.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Yezdis have long been
accustomed to have in their midst professors of
three distinct religions, the Jewish, the Zoroastrian
and the Mohammedan. But as the Jews
are neither numerous nor influential, and the
Zoroastrian Parsis, though more numerous than
the Jews, are nevertheless not more than a tithe
of the population, the religion that chiefly demands
our attention is Mohammedanism, which is the
established faith of Persia. The Mohammedanism
of Persia is not quite the same as that of India
or Turkey, and the Persians call themselves <i>Shiahs</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
or nonconformists. In Persia there is one creed
of nonconformity which is there accepted as
orthodox, so those professing this creed will for
the future in these pages be called Shiahs without
further qualification.</p>

<p>It must, however, be remembered that the
name Shiah is not properly confined to this one
sect, and also that this sect itself, like other nonconformist
bodies, has always shown a great
tendency to subdivide. In Persia besides Shiahs,
that is the more orthodox Shiahs, there has always
been one other smaller sect of Mohammedans
attracting general attention. At present the
dissenting doctrine most widely taught is that
of the Behāīs, who have laid hold of the popular
imagination, partly because of their great steadfastness
under the most terrible persecutions,
partly because of the somewhat popular nature
of their teaching, but chiefly because Persia is
now being brought into rather closer touch with
Europe, and the people as a whole feel that the
teaching of the Shiah mullas needs to be modified
if Islam is to be preserved. I think one may
go further, and say that there is at present in
Persia a period of enquiry and spiritual awakening,
which gives a special opportunity, not only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Mohammedan sectaries, but also to Christian
missionaries. Later on further allusion will be
made to these Behāīs, but we must not forget
that our first task is not so much the study of
the complex religious systems of Persia, as the
analysis of those religious influences to which the
Yezdi has been subjected.</p>

<p>The ordinary Yezdi Mussulman is descended
partly from the original Aryan inhabitants of
Persia, and partly from their Arabian conquerors:
but the enormous difference in character that
exists between him and the purely Aryan Parsi
is certainly due less to race and more to religion,
for the <i>jadīds</i>, or converts from Parsiism, often
develop all the Mussulman characteristics in a few
generations, without the slightest admixture of
race. So before attempting to describe the
character of the people, it will be necessary to
pay as much attention to the religious ideas
that have been brought to bear upon them as
we have already paid to the nature of their
country and the seclusion of their town life.
Some aspects of the Yezdi’s religion will be left
to a future chapter, and we must at present
content ourselves with trying to understand the
essential nature of Islam, particularly dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
on those points of Mohammed’s teaching and
example which seem to have produced most
impression on the Persian mind. To do this
we must divest ourselves of all pre-judgments
of the prophet’s life and doctrine, and simply
study the facts of history, remembering that the
conception of Islam which is to be found amongst
the Sunnis of India and Turkey cannot be allowed
to pass unchallenged, for the Mohammedan world
is by no means unanimous about it; and also
that the well-known European theory, that there
was a difference in Mohammed’s aims and objects
in Mecca and Medina, and that the Meccan period
rather than the Medinan indicates the essential
idea of Mohammedanism, is one which no educated
Mussulman would for a moment tolerate. As for
the still more favourable views that have been
lately brought forward by European authors, I
can only pass on a story that was told me of an
educated Mussulman in India who had been
shown such a treatise. “This gentleman, Sahib,”
he said, as he handed back the volume,
“appears to know very little about his own
religion, and absolutely nothing about ours.”</p>

<p>I myself went to Persia with the intention
of making the most of the good points of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
religious systems of the country. With regard
to the Parsis I was not disappointed. Like many
other missionaries, I started with the idea that
I should find these people possessed of a great
many radically wrong notions about the nature
and power of God, which were essential to their
religion. I now believe that I was wrong, and
I have never heard my right-hand man, Mihraban,
who is himself a Parsi, and also one of the most
sincere and earnest Christians whom I have ever
met, speak one word against the real groundwork
of Zoroastrianism. In this religion it is not
unteaching but teaching that is required to lead
the people to Christ; but, in Mohammedanism,
in spite of its greater pretensions, almost every
apparent truth crumbles into mere truism or
actual falsity the moment that you try to make
it the basis of anything practical. Also the more
I read of the life of Mohammed, the more convinced
I am that the radical rottenness of the
system is due to his original teaching. Perhaps
this may be a confession of narrowness, but one
cannot be broad all round. Unless we are going
to deny the iniquity and wickedness of modern
Islam, we shall have to believe that somebody
is to blame; and, if it is not Mohammed, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
suppose it must be either the mullas or the
Mussulman laity. I do not know why we should
expend all our breadth on the big people: I myself
have some sympathy with the little ones: and I
firmly believe that the difficulties in the Islam
of to-day are due rather to the essential wrongness
of the system than to its corruption by the masses.</p>

<p>Mohammed was born in Mecca towards the
end of the sixth century. He was a member of
the important family who had charge of the
Ka’aba, which was a heathen temple that the
Meccans had attempted to make a common
meeting-ground for the whole of Arabia, by
including within its limits the idols and symbols
of worship that were respected by the different
tribes. Some of these tribes had adopted Christianity
and Judaism; so pictures even of Jewish
and Christian saints were to be found within the
walls of the Meccan temple.</p>

<p>The Mussulman historians of Mohammed’s life
tell us that there had been in Arabia, for some
years before the prophet came forward, a set of
reformers called <i>Hanīfs</i>, who seem to have been
half political and half religious, but to have been
all of them convinced that some form of religion,
purer than that represented by the Ka’aba, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
needed to unite Arabia against its common foes.
Some of these <i>Hanifs</i> ended by adopting Christianity
or Judaism; others were inclined to the
adoption of a more essentially national form of
monotheism, which should retain the Ka’aba as
its centre. The most notable of the latter party
was Zaid ibn Amr, a man so much admired by
Mohammed that he declared him a prophet, and
in other ways professed his complete acceptation
of his principles and teaching.</p>

<p>Mohammed by his marriage with Khadīja was
certainly introduced into this set of reformers.
Waraka ibn Nawfal was one of the most
prominent <i>Hanifs</i>, and we have indisputable
evidence that he was one of Khadija’s most
intimate friends, both at the time of her marriage,
and also at the time when her husband received
his first revelation. Mohammed himself had been
from childhood of a hysterical disposition, and
was subject to fits, during which he saw visions,
which on recovering consciousness he was able to
recollect; consequently while in this company he
became convinced that he was the expected
prophet who was to bind Arabia together by a
politico-religious system.</p>

<p>In placing himself at the head of the <i>Hanif</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
movement, Mohammed probably gave more
prominence to the political aspect than had
most of the former and less successful leaders.
This is brought out by Koelle in his life of
Mohammed; and indeed it is obvious that the
man who could allow an unbelieving friend,
even though a close relation, to play the important
part in the building of his church that
Abbās played in the second meeting on the
eminence, was primarily a politician rather than
a religious reformer: for it was Abbas who on
that occasion first proposed the oath that may
almost be called the basis of Islam. A critical
study of Mohammed’s early dealings with the
Arabians brings us to a similar conclusion.</p>

<p>Of the other stories collected by Koelle from
Mussulman sources to prove this point, perhaps
the most forcible is that of the discussion between
the prophet, his uncle, Abu Tālib, under whose
protection he was then living, and Abu Jahl.
Abu Talib called his nephew and said to him,
“Thou seest the nobles of thy people are
assembled here to concede to thee certain
things, and, in return, to receive concessions
from thee.” Mohammed made this reply:
“Well, then, give me a word whereby the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Arabs may be governed and the Persians subjugated.”
Abu Jahl responded to this request
in the name of his fellow-elders by saying: “Thou
shalt have ten words.” But Mohammed setting
him right, and indicating what kind of word in
his opinion could alone answer the purpose, rejoined:
“Say, ‘There is no God except Allah!’
and renounce what you worship besides Him.”
This story Koelle quotes from Ibn Ishāk, the
earliest and most trustworthy biographer.</p>

<p>Certainly the movement from paganism to
monotheism, which took place in Arabia in
those days, was in itself a fine thing; and it
was accompanied by much sincerity and religious
zeal. It is also obvious that Mohammed possessed
a personality peculiarly attractive to the Arabian,
and that this, as well as his enthusiasm on the
subject of his mission, had the effect of attracting
many to the cause.</p>

<p>But not only did Mohammed pay much more
regard to politics than can be possibly excused,
he also accepted the religious and ethical teaching
of the <i>Hanifs</i> only in the most superficial manner;
and, under the cover of verbal conformity, retained
as much as possible of the original pagan ideas in
which he had been reared. The result is that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
followers are still to be found possessed of what
seems at first sight to be correct doctrine upon
fundamentals, and yet are unable to advance by
its assistance along the path of light and progress.</p>

<p>The popular idea, that fanatical intolerance
of all professors of other religions is an essential
and fundamental principle in Mohammedanism,
cannot be maintained. The paganism of Mecca
was distinctly latitudinarian, so Mohammed
accepted in full the sacred books of the Jews
and Christians, as would have seemed natural
to an Arabian of that age, especially to a monotheistic
teacher who was closely connected with
the Ka’aba. This does not mean that he in any
way apprehended the meaning of Judaism and
Christianity. The doctrine of the perpetuity
of the moral law never seems to have entered
into his mind, even in the most elementary form.
He wished to say that he had himself received
a revelation superseding all former ones by the
mandate of God, and he did not wish to make
trouble by pronouncing other religions to be
false, without absolute necessity. His real object
was to unite the Arabs by a reformed religion,
and at first he regarded his mission as a purely
national one. Whatever were his ultimate designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
upon the Jews and Christians in Arabia, he intentionally
conveyed to them the impression that,
if they recognised him as a prophet to others, he
would be content without their accepting him
themselves. Indeed, while he was still at Mecca,
he was even uncertain whether the idolaters who
accepted him might not be allowed to retain some
of their idols as intermediaries between themselves
and Allah. He went so far on one occasion as
to actually effect a reconciliation on this basis;
but as such a concession must have greatly
damaged his influence with those who were
favourably disposed to the <i>Hanif</i> movement, he
afterwards repudiated the transaction, and declared
that he had acted under the influence of the devil.
His work in Mecca was not very successful; and
the opposition he encountered was so strong that
he had at last to begin to make attempts to start
work in some other place, and he was finally
successful in making a fresh beginning in Medina.
Here he was able to take advantage of a family
connection with some of the principal citizens,
and also of a long-standing rivalry between
Medina and Mecca. Although the movement
in Mecca had not been widely successful,
Mohammed had gathered amongst his followers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
several really prominent men. Consequently,
the people of Medina, although divided on the
subject of his prophetic mission, were unanimous
as to the advisability of receiving him and his
followers into their town. Settled in Medina,
Mohammed’s fortunes underwent a change. The
chieftancy of the tribe to which his grandmother
had belonged fell vacant, and, as most of the
members of this tribe had become Mussulmans,
Mohammed had no difficulty in himself becoming
their chief. Considering himself restrained by
no preconception or former revelation of the
moral law, he was able, without dropping for
one moment his pretensions to prophethood, to
use every means of fraud and violence which
seemed conducive to his political end. As Koelle
has pointed out, there is no reason to suppose
that his principles in any way changed, but under
the altered conditions and environment the
utterly non-ethical theory of revelation held by
the prophet became more apparent. This is
perhaps most clearly brought out by his utterly
unscrupulous dealing with the Jews, and also
by the story of Zaid and Zainab, in all which
affairs Mohammed professed himself to be acting
under Divine direction, nor is it at all obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that he did not actually believe it. Finally,
before his death, he succeeded in establishing his
religion and political system throughout the
whole of Arabia.</p>

<p>Of course it was impossible for a movement
like this to take place without rival prophets
appearing in other parts of the country. Two
of these appeared during Mohammed’s lifetime,
and he thought it best to guard against future
schisms of a similar kind by declaring himself
the last of the prophets. Exactly what he
meant by this is not very clear: if the almost
universal voice of Islam is to be accepted, he did
not mean that he was the last divinely appointed
teacher, for all Mussulmans look forward to the
coming of a Mehdi or Mahdi, who, together with
Jesus, the son of Mary, is to appear in the last
days, and spread the doctrines of Islam throughout
the world. Orthodox Mussulmans, however,
always look upon Mohammed as the last great
<i>sāhibi kitāb</i>, or book-bearer.</p>

<p>The ordinary Sunnis, who are the largest and
best-known Mussulman sect, assert that, as a
matter of fact, since the time of Mohammed, no
divinely-appointed teacher has as yet appeared.
The Khalīfs were in their eyes simply appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
by the congregation, and the four great writers
of the <i>sunnat</i>, which is to them the only authoritative
commentary upon the doctrines of Islam,
were only learned and saintly men. Now, they
hold, these doctrines can only be learnt from
this book, and from the <i>Qurān</i> itself; for the
<i>mujtahid</i> or high mulla, capable of giving
authoritative decisions on moot points, no longer
exists.</p>

<p>The Shiahs have very different tenets.
Mohammed according to their teaching was the
first of a hierarchic dynasty of thirteen, consisting
of himself and the twelve great Imāms, of whom
the first was Ali, the son-in-law of the prophet,
and who were all as certainly divinely appointed
as Mohammed himself. Mohammed is only the
last great book-bearer, and therefore the founder
of the present era. The last of the Imams was
the Mehdi, who according to the Sunnis has not
yet been born, but according to the Shiahs
appeared long ago. This man did not die, but
disappeared, remaining at first accessible to his
followers through the medium of four successive
Bābs, or gates of knowledge, who were in touch
with him during his concealment. Like the
Imams, the Babs came to an end, for the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of them refused to appoint a successor. All this
of course is very ancient history.</p>

<p>The Shiahs have their own traditionists, for
they reject the <i>sunnat</i> altogether. Between the
traditions of the Shiahs and the Sunnis there is
not much to choose: there is a certain amount
of historical fact embodied in both, and there is
also a great deal of absolute nonsense. However,
many otherwise orthodox Shiahs either reject the
traditions altogether, or interpret them allegorically.
There is more freedom of interpretation
amongst the Shiahs than amongst the Sunnis:
indeed many Shiahs believe that some of the
most objectionable chapters of the <i>Quran</i> describing
the delights of heaven are entirely parabolic.
Of course with <i>mujtahids</i> (supposed to be able to
pronounce authoritatively on moot points) scattered
all over Persia, the fixity of doctrine that prevails
amongst Mohammedans of Sunni countries would
be impossible.</p>

<p>The tenets of the Shiahs are not derogatory to
the mission of Mohammed, or to the position of
the <i>Quran</i>, but they make the solitary figure of
the prophet stand out much less prominently.
For instance, if a Persian is told that his religion
possesses nothing corresponding to the vicarious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sacrifice of Christ, he will invariably reply by
pointing to the martyrdom of the Imam Husain.
Also the Mehdi, or occult Imam, is not the future,
but the present ruler of Islam; and so he is in
some ways as important a personage as the
original prophet. Not very long ago the Shah
of Persia used to pay rent for his palace to the
Mehdi, the money going to the <i>mujtahids</i> as the
representatives of the Imam: I do not know
whether this practice is still continued, but the
theory on which it was based is certainly not
extinct. Again there is a common saying that
the Imam Ali is present in the heart of the true
believer, but I think it is only regarded by the
ordinary Yezdi as a poetical expression. The
point to be noted is that the saying is always
about Ali, not about Mohammed. Shiahs invoke
the Imams Ali and Husain very much more
frequently than they invoke Mohammed; and
though the inscription over a Persian mosque
should be, “<i>Yā Ali, Yā Muhammad</i>,” that is,
“O Ali! O Mohammed!” the “<i>Yā Muhammad</i>”
is often omitted and the “<i>Yā Ali</i>” left to stand
alone. The excuse is sometimes brought forward
that Mohammed is too great for constant invocation.
Considering the way in which the Shiah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
uses the name of God, this must, I think, be
regarded as a mere excuse for a habit due to
wholly different causes.</p>

<p>This extreme attachment to the Imams is
probably due to two things. In the first place,
there can be no doubt that the cause of Ali and
his sons was taken up in Persia as an outlet to
national jealousy, for the Aryan converts were
not sorry when a pretext occurred for differentiating
themselves from the majority of their
Arab conquerors. In the Shiah religion the early
Khalifs, who ruled Islam while the holy Imams
were still alive, are held up to the bitterest
execration, and Omar in particular, who, by the
way, was the conqueror of Persia, takes much
the same place in the Shiah system that Judas
Iscariot does in the Christian.</p>

<p class="caption">SMALL SQUARE IN YEZD.</p>
<p class="caption">To the left is a small Nakhl, and in the centre a mosque door with the inscription “Ya Ali.”</p>
</div>

<p>Secondly, the influence of sects of mystics,
professedly Mohammedan but having in their
doctrines a distinctly pantheistic tendency, must
be remembered. Ancient Persia was full of
pantheism, and when it became Mussulman the
inclination towards such teaching still continued,
for the broader views held by the Shiahs as to
freedom of interpretation in reading the <i>Quran</i>
gave a possible status in the country to very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
heretical sects. These Persian mystics often
preferred to make the Imams, especially Ali, at
least as prominent in their systems as Mohammed,
whose teaching was more difficult to bend to
their purposes; and although the ordinary Yezdi
is certainly not a pantheist, they have undoubtedly
intensified his enthusiasm for the personalities of
the Imams, and through their poetry they have
familiarised him with religious expressions of a
somewhat unorthodox character. This is in some
ways an advantage to the missionary, but he
must beware that it does not give him a false
view of the progress that he is making.</p>

<p>As to the theory of the divinely appointed
Imamate it might be urged that the retention
of the whole glory of the early sainthood for the
close relations and descendants of the prophet
is an excess of zeal that Mohammed would have
greatly approved. However this may be, the
doctrine is not obviously opposed to Mohammedanism.</p>

<p>The Shiahs are certainly much laxer than the
Sunnis with regard to some of the commandments
of the <i>Qurān</i>. Painting, and the making of figures
is considered by the Sunnis to be a violation of the
law against idolatry. There is, however, a regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
school of Persian painting; and clay models of men,
animals and demons, as well as rag dolls, are given
to the children as toys. The protests made by the
mullas against these things are very faint. They
are rather louder in their denunciations of all forms
of music, which amongst orthodox Mohammedans
is supposed to have no purpose but the exciting of
the passions. As to the drinking of wine and
spirits, the avoidance of the regular Mohammedan
fast in the month of Ramazān, and the omission of
the prescribed prayers, the Shiah mullas take a
view which is at least intelligible. To begin with,
such things do not amount to infidelity unless they
are done wilfully and consistently. A formal
acceptation of the whole of the ordinances is
demanded. There must be no drunkenness in the
streets, no eating in Ramazan when anybody is
near unless a legitimate excuse can be brought
forward, and if prayers have not been said men
must say that they have said them. Further than
this external government does not go; and as a
matter of fact many irreligious Persians secretly
drink themselves drunk in their houses, forget to
say their prayers regularly, and make up what
would, if true, be valid excuses for not keeping the
fast in Ramazan. Such people are well aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that they are liable to punishment, but they also
know that, unless they prove disloyal to Islam by
accepting some other faith, they are not in any
great danger. It is true that every now and again
the mullas incite the people to join them in
cleansing the land of infidelity, and on such
occasions sectaries like the Babis, and those who
are supposed to sympathise with them, may
greatly suffer, but those who have been merely lax
in their observance of Islam are apt to make up
for their past deficiencies by a peculiar show of zeal.</p>

<p>It may be asked whether the mullas in Persia
are justified in making no more persistent efforts
to enforce Mohammedan law, and whether their
winking at such irregularities is not in itself
disloyalty to the system of Islam. Probably it
would be easy for them to show that they were
justified by the example of Mohammed himself.
If Mohammed enforced a much stricter discipline
in the town where he was himself present—a
matter which I think is open to doubt—it would
be almost impossible to maintain that he caused
such discipline to be enforced among the Arab
tribes. These tribes were generally accepted
through the medium of their chief, who usually
came to Mohammed in person, had a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
interview with him, part of which was devoted to
political subjects, and often went back to his tribe
on the same day. It is true that Mohammed
made a distinction between hypocrites—<i>munāfiqīn</i>,
and true believers, but he generally meant by
hypocrites people who were not really on his side
against others, and here the ordinary Shiah is
unimpeachable.</p>

<p>The fact is that Islam contains much more than
an assortment of commandments. Otherwise it
would never have impressed its adherents in so
distinct and remarkable a manner with special
characteristics. The central idea of the religion is
that we are all under the dominion of an invisible
and absolutely powerful God, Who has created all
things, and has willed and ordained everything
both good and evil that is to be found in the
universe. It is true that there is a Shiah dogma
against the extreme predestinarianism which
characterises the Sunni creed, but I do not believe
that it has in the least affected the fatalistic view
of the ordinary people. In Islam God may be
called good because it is our duty to accept as good
whatever He does, and He may also be called
by other names according to the character of His
known actions towards us; but His own nature is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
absolutely different from that of man; consequently
nothing can be known of His moral
character beyond the fact of certain explicit
actions. This God from time to time sends to the
world prophets, whose duty is to teach mankind
the doctrine of His unity, the necessity of worship,
and the necessity of doing what is for the time
being His will. According to the popular opinion
there have been a hundred and forty-four thousand
of these prophets, but of this number only a few
have been authorised to publish a new code of
human duty. Those so authorised are known as
book-bearers, and Adam, Seth, Enoch, Abraham,
Moses, David, Jesus, and Mohammed were all of
this class. The Behāīs add the name of Behāu’llah
after that of Mohammed. These book-bearers are
always marked by the possession of some sort of
supernatural powers appealing to the intellect, and
also, in the case of the latter ones, by the fulfilment
of signs mentioned by the former prophets.
Obedience to them is rewarded by various degrees
of bliss in Heaven, disobedience is punished by
Hell. The prophet must conform to previous
revelations in the assertion of God’s unity,
invisibility and omnipotence, but it is not necessary
that there should be any coherence between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
directions about human action as set forth in
successive dispensations, nor is any difference made
between ceremonial and moral commandments.</p>

<p>This central doctrine of Mohammedanism
concerns God, the prophet, man and creation;
so we come across it under four names, giving
the four possible points of view. First of all
there is the name of <i>tauhīd</i>, or assertion of the
Divine unity. The Mussulman means by this very
much more than the mere assertion that God is
a single Being. He includes in it the doctrine
of the invisibility of God and of His absolutely
separate nature, and it appears to clash with the
Christian conception in two important particulars.
There is an absolute denial of the statement, upon
which most Christians more or less consciously
base their belief in the perpetuity and absolute
nature of the law of human morals, that “in the
image of God created He man.” Consequently
we shall afterwards find that in Islam there is no
belief in the permanency of the moral law, for
nothing is thought by the Mussulman to be
necessarily permanent except things connected
with the nature of God; and as our nature
differs entirely from that of the Creator the
law given for it cannot be necessarily permanent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
There is also in reality a fundamental contradiction
of Christian doctrine in the Mohammedan’s
rendering of the statement that God is a single
Being. This is best explained by a simple illustration.
Supposing a man were to say, “London is
one place,” it is conceivable that he might mean
one of two things. Either he might mean that
the City of London was the only true London,
and that there was no other part of the town in
Middlesex or Surrey that ought to be called by
the same name; or he might mean that the whole
of those places which go by the name of the
County of London are in reality only one place;
and these two statements are not similar statements
with a slight difference, but they are
absolutely contradictory. So the Christian says
there is only one God, by which he means to
assert the unity of the all-good Creator, the all-good
Personality Who was revealed as the Son,
and the all-good Spirit Who is the only source
of good in the heart. As God to the Christian
means the All-good, what he needs is a doctrine
that asserts the essential unity of the All-good
wherever he finds it. The Christian is of course
not a pantheist, but his conception of the one
God has to be sufficiently inclusive to cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
those Three Who, as he knows, certainly possess
the attributes of Deity. The Mussulman on the
other hand does not pretend to know anything
about the attributes of Deity, excepting that
God is one, invisible and omnipotent. Consequently
he frames his definition of the Deity
so as to purposely exclude what the Christian
with his larger knowledge knows to be the manifestation
of the same essence.</p>

<p>To pass on to the Mussulman’s conception of
his religion as it relates to the prophet. The
<i>paighambarī</i>, or the bringing of messages from
the Deity, is in many ways a peculiar idea.
Mohammed himself had very little notion of
his message being an advance on what had been
given before, and of the gradual growth of revelation
he had no conception at all. He was content
to assert that his teaching was the religion of
Abraham, a phrase of which he frequently made
use. It is true that Mussulmans sometimes say
that parts of God’s Word were revealed to former
<i>paighambars</i>, but that the complete commandment
was given to Mohammed, and although
this is very different from the Christian doctrine
of the growth of revelation, it might possibly be
regarded as a substitute for it; but the fact is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that, though it may be traceable to the prophet,
it is quite foreign to the essential system of
Islam. We frequently find such foreign ideas
which have been imported into Islam, occasionally
by Mohammed but more frequently by his
followers, simply to answer some specific objection,
or to maintain the superiority of the system over
all others. Such importations can as a rule be
easily separated from the essential doctrines of
Islam, and in most cases they have not affected
the general character of the religion. This is due
to the religion as first conceived by Mohammed
having been clear in its essential points, and it
is these points rather than the accretions that
have left such a strong mark upon the body of
Mussulmans. The <i>paighambari</i>, more than any
other doctrine or expression of doctrine, brings
out with intense plainness the fundamental distinction
between the Mussulman and the Christian,
that enormous divergence of view regarding the
moral law which lies at the root of almost all
their differences in subordinate theories and
tenets. So when we are discussing the influence
of Mohammedan ideas upon character, it is well to
remember that sects which do not hold this theory
of the <i>paighambari</i> ought to be regarded separately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>There are in Persia sects which are only
nominally Mussulman, and which largely owe
their origin to non-Mohammedan sources. The
Sūfis, for instance, are only half Mohammedan,
and their philosophy is really pantheistic. Sufis
are to be found in Yezd, but there are not very
many serious ones, and the sect has largely lost
its direct influence in the country. But the Babis,
of whom the Behāī branch is rapidly spreading
everywhere throughout the Persian towns, have
been influenced by Sufi ideas to a much greater
extent than have the orthodox Shiahs, who, we
agreed, are not pantheistic. Perhaps some
professing Behāīs are really very near to the
Sufis in ideas, but this is not the case with the
more orthodox, who, though they have modified
the fundamental doctrines of Mohammedanism
in such a way as to remove the gulf between
God and the prophet, have not produced a
theology which is free from the obvious defects
of that of Islam. The Behāī appears to hold
that the superior prophet, that is, the book-bearer,
is in every case an incarnation of the
Deity, but he goes on to say that there is an
absolute distinction between the prophet and his
people; for the book-bearer is God, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
people are not God; nor are they, so far as I
can understand, capable of receiving the Spirit of
God, either from the prophet or directly from
God Himself. They can only be impressed by
the prophet as wax is impressed by a seal.
Whether this doctrine is really Behāu’llah’s or
not, it was certainly given to me by men who
ought to have known the truth about the Behāī
faith.</p>

<p>The adherents of this sect in Persia are now
exceedingly numerous, and many people believe
that in the end the whole country will become
Behāī; so the question whether the Behāīs are
more reliable than the orthodox Shiahs has
become an important one. Certainly they teach
a cleaner and purer doctrine on points of ethics;
but what Persia needs is not so much a higher
moral teaching, but rather a higher basis for
morality. A religion that puts the commandment
not to steal on the same level as the
direction not to stew your dates but to fry them,
will never produce the high characters that are
to be found in such communities as the Parsi. It
would be irreverent to compare such a faith
with the religion given to us by the Saviour.</p>

<p>During the late Behāī massacre, I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
opportunity of discussing what was going on
with a Behāī <i>muballigh</i>, that is, an authorised
Behāī teacher and missionary. I have no intention
of unnecessarily dwelling on the ghastly
horrors that were then being perpetrated, but
a few details are unavoidable. The Behāī sectaries
were not at that time being executed
before the <i>mujtahids</i>, but were being torn in
pieces by the crowd. What had excited the
people was not simply religious feeling, but it
was very largely the statement by the clerical
authorities that the goods of the Behāīs were
“lawful,” that is, that any one might plunder
them who cared to do so. The attacks were
often made by men who had lived for a long
while in close companionship with the Behāīs,
knowing them all the time to be members of
the sect, and yet consorting and eating with
them freely. Holes were bored in the heads
of some of these poor wretches with awls, oil
was then poured into the hole and lighted. Other
forms of torture were used about which one
cannot write. Women and children were very
seldom actually killed, but were fearfully ill-treated,
and sometimes left to die of starvation.
It was reported that in one of the villages Babi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
children died within full sight of the villagers,
after waiting for days under the trees where
their murdered parents had left them.</p>

<p>The Behāī <i>muballigh</i> with whom I was talking
was certainly well aware, in a general way, of
what was going on; yet I could not get him to
see that these things, done in the name of religion
to his own sect, were in themselves wrong, and
that man’s eyes had been opened, or could be
opened, to their essential wrongness. Of course
he maintained that the action of the Mussulmans
was evil, but his reason was that, in the first
place, those persecuted were spiritually right,
and, in the second place, even had they not been
so, the last book-bearer, the Behāu’llah, had
promulgated a Divine commandment that there
was to be no religious persecution. I then asked
him if such persecution could again become lawful
if another book-bearer appeared and promulgated
a different commandment. He answered that it
was impossible for another book-bearer to appear
for a long period. I then asked him if he would
accept a new book-bearer, who, besides satisfying
the other conditions, exhibited a text in one
of the previously received Scriptures, stating
that one day in God’s sight is as a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
years. He replied that, if such a verse could
be shown, and the other conditions were satisfied,
such a man might be accepted to-morrow, even
although he taught a doctrine similar to that
of Mohammed about religious persecution and
other matters of the same sort.</p>

<p>Now there are three points to be noted by
those who expect great things of the Behāī movement.
First of all, the Behāīs accept the whole
of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, which,
of course, include a verse of the kind above
mentioned. Secondly, they have already had
three book-bearers; the Bab, who was the original
founder of the Babi sects, and who not only
exhibited a Divine book, but also claimed to be
the resurrection of Mohammed in the same way
that Mohammed was the resurrection of Jesus;
Subhi Azal, whom for some years they recognised
as the Bab’s successor; and lastly, Behāu’llah,
whom the Behāīs now hold to be the only major
prophet of the three. Thirdly, the Behāīs, in
attempting to prove that the Bab was a lesser
prophet and a mere forerunner of the Behāu’llah,
and also that Subhi Azal was never a really
great personage, have seriously falsified their
records. The reader who desires further information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
on this subject cannot do better than consult
Professor E. G. Browne’s admirable introduction
to his translation of the <i>Tārīkhi Jadīd</i>.</p>

<p>The Bab, who came forward rather less than
a century ago, was a young Shirazi Persian, a
Seyid of the merchant class, whose real name
was Ali Mohammed. The Shaikhi sect were at
that time predicting the appearance of a great
religious leader, and the Bab came forward claiming
to be this prophet. He called himself the
Bab, or Gate of Knowledge, and was at first
supposed by his followers to be the Gate of
Access to the Mehdi; but he seems to have used
these terms in a very broad and allegorical fashion,
and to have held the doctrine of the essential
unity of all book-bearers. He later declared
himself to be the Mehdi, and also to be the Gate
of Access to One Whom God should manifest.</p>

<p>The movement caused a great deal of fighting
in Persia, and though the Babis were acting on
the defensive, there is very little doubt that they
had harboured political designs. The Bab, however,
differs from Mohammed in having been,
so far as we can judge, primarily a religious
reformer, and having done his best to make the
movement as spiritual as possible. His followers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
were treated with the most barbarous severity,
and he himself was after a few years put to
death. Before this he appointed Subhi Azal,
one of his followers, to be his successor, and for
a few years this man was received as “He Whom
God should manifest.” Later on, Subhi Azal’s
half-brother, the Behāu’llah, managed to get
himself accepted as head of the sect. Many of
the followers of Subhi Azal were assassinated,
and the sect was re-organised with some important
differences. It now purports to be absolutely
non-political, and the teaching has become more
simple and practical. The Behāīs are anxious
to retain the use of the <i>Quran</i>, so as to preserve
their claim to toleration, although they imagine
that the law of the <i>Quran</i> no longer stands, its
place having been taken by a later revelation.
Partially to avoid inconsistency in this matter,
and partially to keep before the minds of the
Mussulmans the possibility of one really divine
book being replaced by another, they encourage
the reading of all the Scripture considered divine
by Mohammedans, that is, not only the <i>Quran</i>,
but also the whole of the Christian Bible, nor
do they generally call the authenticity of the
extant version in question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Behāīism is obviously an attempt to adapt
Islam to the exigencies of modern circumstances,
taking advantage of the special tenets of the
Shiahs. The North of Persia is being at present
rapidly overrun by Russia, and even in the South
the Persian feels that he is on the eve of political
changes. The Behāīs consider that they have
a creed which enables them to meet the foreigner
without continual jar and offence. In this they
are right, for they do not veil their women, they
do not consider infidels unclean, and they go
further than does the broadest Shiah in the matter
of respect to other forms of faith. Some orthodox
Shiahs accept the Jewish and Christian Scriptures
as they stand, without pressing the story that
the Jews and Christians altered their books to
suit their own purposes. Almost all Persians are
open to argument on this point, though most will
say that to those possessed of the <i>Quran</i> the
perusal of former Scriptures is unnecessary. But
the Behāīs hold that, unless started by a real
prophet, no religion can possibly survive, and
consequently they allow to even the grossest
forms of idolatry a divine origin, and the possession
of a certain substratum of truth.</p>

<p>In Persia there can never have been that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
almost impenetrable wall of dogmatic assertion
and self-assurance which seems to exist in many
Sunni lands, but something of the kind is to be
found throughout Islam. As the self-satisfaction
of the Behāī is almost as strong as that of the
Sunni, and infinitely stronger than that of the
Shiah, it seems a paradox to say that Babiism
has given us in Persia a prepared soil for missionary
work. The fact is that the field prepared is not
amongst the Babis themselves, but amongst the
Shiahs who have been in touch with Babis, and
are nevertheless unconvinced. Consequently it
is a field which cannot be expected to last for
ever, but of which advantage ought to be taken
immediately, for it is very seldom that we find
so exceptional an opportunity given to us for
attacking Mohammedanism on its own ground.</p>

<p>In Yezd the Behāīs have attached to themselves
many of the most enlightened Mussulmans.
The teaching of the sect about behaviour and
practice is not bad, though, in matters connected
with women, there is an inclination to adopt
customs that are rather dangerous considering
the low moral atmosphere. The tendency to
minimise the miraculous element in religion is
not altogether wholesome, and some professing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Babis are inclined to a rather crude rationalism,
the end of which it is difficult to foresee. This
tendency is perhaps fostered by the peculiar
manner of interpreting the sacred books, a method
difficult to describe, as it fluctuates between the
wildest flights of metaphor, and the lowest depths
of puerile literalism, the balance between the
two being decided by a very determined preconception
of what ought to be. To give a
specimen of this, it was seriously urged in a Behāī
pamphlet, reviewed and summarised by the Rev.
W. A. Rice in the <i>Church Missionary Intelligencer</i>,
that Isaiah xxv. 6-9, where God is described as
making “unto all people a feast of fat things, a
feast of wine on the lees, of fat things full of
marrow, of wines on the lees well refined,” refers
to the entertaining of visitors by Behāu’llah during
his banishment at Acre. The “wines on the lees
well refined” are the tea, which Persians generally
pour through a small strainer. The passage also
refers to the fact that God “will swallow up
death in victory,” and will “wipe away all tears
from off all faces; and the rebuke of His people
shall He take away from off all the earth.” To
this part only a spiritual interpretation is given.</p>

<p>I tried before I left Persia to find out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
impression that the sect had made upon other
Europeans, so as not to give a one-sided opinion
about them. Personally, I came to the conclusion
that, in matters even remotely connected with
religion, they were less truthful than the ordinary
Shiah, but that in the ordinary affairs of life
they were a trifle more reliable. Some other
missionaries had a lower opinion of their truthfulness,
and most of those who had had business
dealings with them considered that they were
not more trustworthy than ordinary Mussulmans.
My conclusion is that, though they may succeed
in establishing their creed in Persia, and may
even make the Persians more easy to deal with,
they will not greatly alter the moral character
of the people. They have not done so hitherto,
and an examination of their faith shows that
they cling, in the main, to the Mussulman theory
of the <i>paighambari</i>, or at any rate have not
changed it for a doctrine which gives a man more
cogent reasons for adhering to an approved line
of conduct in times of difficulty.</p>

<p>The name given in Mohammed’s system to
the state of the true believer is <i>Islām</i>, which
means “Resignation to God.” By this the
Mussulman seems to understand that he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
not criticise the prophet, whatever he may do
or teach, and that in the same way he must
accept everything that happens as the will of
God. A waiving of personal responsibility, and
an acceptance of all occurrences as the Divine
intention, is to the Persian an undoubted virtue.
The steadfast pursuit of a purpose which has been
thwarted will often appear to him actually vicious,
although such persistency might be justified in
his eyes by its success, which would prove it to
have been in harmony with God’s will.</p>

<p>The word which expresses the duty of the
believer being <i>Islam</i>, or resignation, the corresponding
word used by the Mussulman to describe
his theory of the course of events is <i>taqdīr</i>, or
predestination. There is, as I have said, in Shiah
dogma an attempt to modify the extreme predestinarian
doctrines of the Sunni. But these
doctrines are so much an integral part of Mohammedanism
that it is impossible for the Mussulman,
Shiah or otherwise, to be anything but a gross
fatalist. This then completes the list of names
under which the essential and fundamental conceptions
of Islam are taught, <i>Tauhid</i>, <i>Paighambari</i>,
<i>Islam</i>, and <i>Taqdir</i>.</p>

<p>There are also in Mohammedanism certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
other doctrines which seem to be part of the
system, but which are not quite so fundamental as
those that have been stated. Some of these are
not quite plain: it is very difficult, for instance, to
understand what was Mohammed’s teaching on the
forgiveness of sins, and there is great confusion of
thought on this point amongst his followers.
Certainly an infidel becoming a Mussulman has his
sins forgiven, though he does not expect to receive
any peculiar strength for the future, but only a
direction as to what God wants him to do and to
avoid. After this the motives of his actions will
be <i>khauf u jizā</i>, that is to say, the fear of Hell and
the expectation of Heaven. He will have to be
punished in Hell for his sins according to their
assessed value, unless he has previously wiped them
out, either by <i>savābs</i>, that is, by works of merit, or
by repentance. Repentance of a real kind is
supposed to have a certain value, though it is hard
to state exactly what that value is. Formal
repentance, which does not in the mind of the
common Persian necessarily involve the giving up
of such fruits of sin as stolen articles, has also a
certain value. But the most efficient way of
atoning for sin is by <i>savabs</i>. Finally no
Mussulman, at any rate among the Shiahs, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
consider it justifiable to hold himself free from the
fear of Hell.</p>

<p>Punishment in Hell according to the
Mussulman idea is not necessarily everlasting, for
most of the Persians believe that, by the intercession
of Mohammed, all his people will finally
get to Heaven. But in Heaven there are many
grades, and the position of the individual will be
determined by the relative weight of his <i>savabs</i>
and sins. Properly, a <i>savab</i> is a work of
supererogation considered as possessing merit; but
the word is often used less exactly for any action
which will be put to the account of a man as a
good deed. I believe that Persian Mohammedans
when using this word almost universally accept
the view that the performance of a certain number
of approved actions makes it less necessary to
adhere to the path of duty. Also, to put it
crudely, the good deed is not regarded as the gift
of God to man, but as the gift of man to God;
and I feel convinced that the word is bound up
with the assumption that Heaven-seeking or the
fear of Hell are the only possible motives for right
behaviour.</p>

<p>The ordinary Yezdi has no doubt that a non-Mussulman
can do a <i>savab</i>, especially if he benefits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a Mussulman; and the belief that such a man if he
was a Jew or a Christian, could get to Heaven,
would not be considered very heretical.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Some
Yezdis might allow that idolaters could get to
Heaven by <i>savabs</i>, but this would be considered a
more dangerous doctrine. The fact is that there
was in Mohammed’s essential teaching a very large
amount of latitudinarianism, and this comes out in
the common ideas of Mussulmans who are not
repressed by a system such as that of the Sunnis.</p>

<p>The merit of an action is decided by the
intention of the doer and not by its result. This
is brought out by a native story, framed for the
purpose.</p>

<p>“One day a traveller came to a well, where he
dismounted, fastened his animal to a pin, and
satisfied his thirst. As he returned to his animal
it occurred to him that it would be a <i>savab</i> to
leave the pin behind, for other travellers who
might wish to tether their beasts. The next to
arrive at the well was a man on foot, who, being
very thirsty and in a hurry, fell over the pin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
This man threw the pin down the well, so as to
prevent any one else from having a similar
accident. A learned man in the neighbourhood
was asked which of the two did the <i>savab</i>, the man
who left the pin or the man who threw it away.
He answered, ‘Both, for their intentions were
equally good.’”</p>

<p>That there is truth in this teaching is obvious,
but the story ignores the necessity of taking
thought and pains, so that one’s impulses may not
do more harm than good. This is always ignored
in Persia, and I think I am right in putting it
down to the teaching connected with the use of
the word. Large sums of money are given for the
poor, and yet the alleviation of poverty is very
small; and the same sort of thing happens in other
branches of philanthropy. The gift once given,
the donor loses all interest in its bestowal; funds
are squandered on the most paltry objects, and the
general effect seems to be that money given in this
way becomes money wasted. Charity is also
much vitiated in Persia by unpractical, and in
many cases superstitious ideas. To give alms to a
Seyid is a greater <i>savab</i> than to help an ordinary
beggar, so a large proportion of the philanthropy of
Persia goes to support a begging class, who are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
every way a burden, and in some ways a danger
to society. The Seyids are also more lightly
punished, and consider themselves outside the
reach of the very small amount of justice that
exists. Again, it is more meritorious to give on
a Thursday, as the eve of the Friday holiday, or
on the eve of a feast, than on an ordinary day;
and lastly, the people expect that they will amass
more merit by giving microscopic sums to all
comers than by giving more effective assistance
to a limited number.</p>

<p>As I have said, the doctrine connected with
<i>savabs</i> acknowledges only two motives of
action, the fear of punishment and the expectation
of reward, and it is not allowed that any
other motive can possibly exist. Persian women
are very inquisitive, and one day some of them
were questioning the ladies of the Yezd mission
as to what they ate for breakfast. When it transpired
that the others ate eggs and one did not,
the remark was immediately made, “You see she
is trying to get a higher place in Heaven.” At
another time when my wife was trying to explain
to some women that we do not look to works of
merit to secure salvation, she was met by the
answer, “But the <i>Hakīm Khānum</i> (lady doctor)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
does; or why should she have taken all that
trouble about the Seyid’s wife when she was
ill?”</p>

<p>Shiahs often consider that by letting others
do a <i>savab</i> for them they confer a favour greater
than they themselves receive. One might imagine
that this would only apply to benefactors who
agreed with their religious notions; but even if
you can convince a Shiah that you do not believe
in the possibility of winning Heaven by <i>savabs</i>, he
will reply, very logically, that your want of faith
does not prevent the fact being true, and that
it is absurd to expect him to be grateful because
of your unbelief in facts. I remember trying to
make a very badly-behaved youngster, who was
in the school under my charge, see that we had
some reason to expect more gratitude from him,
as we had really taken great trouble with him,
and Christians did not think it necessary to do
such things for the sake of their future welfare.
His answer was that if we did not consider that
<i>savabs</i> were necessary Mussulmans did.</p>

<p><i>Savabs</i> are not necessarily good actions, but
almost all actions which are directly kind are
included in the term. So although the doctrine
connected with <i>savabs</i> is not in every way a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thing, it still has a certain value. Of course it is
true that men who are anxious to do big <i>savabs</i>
in order to wipe off the sins of very evil lives
generally choose non-ethical ones. During the
late Babi massacre a soldier found a Yezdi who
was dragging about another man, and trying to
make out whether he was really a Behāī. “You
see,” he said, “I have been a wicked man all my
life, and have never said my prayers or done any
other <i>savabs</i>, so, unless I can do a big <i>savab</i>, I
shall certainly go to Hell. If this man is a Babi,
I mustn’t let him go, for if I kill an infidel of
course I shall go straight to Heaven.” Nevertheless
the ordinary <i>savab</i> is a kind action, and
in the idea of their efficacy we get something
almost corresponding to a moral principle. Sometimes
indeed the Persian’s conception of a work
of merit tends to correct and check the worse
commandments of his code. For instance,
although the killing of a Babi as an infidel
may be considered a <i>savab</i>, the saving of a life,
even if it is the life of the same Babi, may also
be held a meritorious act of a different kind.</p>

<p>That the Persian’s notions as to what constitutes
an act of merit are a saving clause in
his religion I have no doubt at all. I am, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not quite certain whether this saving clause
properly belongs to Mohammedanism, for it bears
on the face of it a family likeness to the doctrines
of superior systems, and it will not quite fit into
the system of Islam. The rest of the Shiah ideas
about Heaven, Hell, the efficacy of <i>savabs</i>, and
repentance, seem to be really Mussulman, though
everything is not quite coherent. Perhaps the
fact is that in these points Mohammed was an
opportunist, and taught any doctrine which he
thought would make people obedient to his law.
He was careful not to expect too much, and,
while keeping his followers as long as possible in
a state of uncertainty as to their salvation, he
tried never to shut the door on hope. So it is
questionable whether either the teaching of the
Quran, or the ideas of the Persians on these
subjects, could possibly be presented in a quite
consistent form.</p>

<p>I have tried to enumerate in this chapter just
those doctrines which form the original philosophy
or theology upon which everything in Islam rests,
and to show that not only does the ordinary Shiah
Yezdi accept them <i>in toto</i>, but that, with the one
small exception that has been stated, all his fundamental
beliefs are to be found in this category.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Of course these ideas are a much more serious
part of a religion than is a code of commandments
that is not believed to be permanent.
Indeed it is quite possible that greater laxity in
the observance of such a code may be due to a
juster appreciation of the notions with which it
was promulgated. To say that Persia has not
been greatly influenced by Mohammedanism
because the Persians get drunk in their houses,
is shallow criticism. It is still shallower to
imagine that the fact that some of the Shiah
ordinances are in themselves laxer than the Sunni
makes it plain that Persians are less Mussulman
than Turks and Indians.</p>

<p>For instance, the Shiahs have a custom of
temporary marriages, according to which it is
lawful for a man, besides the four regular wives
allowed by Islam, to have as many inferior wives
as he likes, contracting these marriages for any
length of time he pleases, from a few days upwards.
There is, however, a legal fiction by which these
women are supposed to be lowered to the rank
of slaves, which ought to entirely remove the
Sunni objection; for, unless it can be proved
that the temporary ownership of a slave is impossible,
it is very difficult to understand why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
this evasion should not be considered quite
legitimate according to the undoubted principles
of Mohammedanism. That there is a certain
amount of latitudinarianism in Shiah Islam is
indisputable, but so there is in the whole of
Mohammed’s teaching and practice.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact his attitude towards Jews
and Christians, and even towards the idolaters,
was largely opportunist. At one time he made
leagues with the Jews, promising that they
should not be disturbed in their religion; at
other times he picked quarrels with them, and
put every one who would not accept Islam to
the sword. This latitudinarianism has found its
way into the Quran itself, where a verse is to
be found telling Mohammedans that they may
eat the food of “the people of the book,” that
is, of the people holding religions whose origin
he recognised as divine. The strict Shiahs in
Yezd interpret this as meaning dry food. They
make a great distinction between wet and dry;
only a few years ago it was dangerous for an
Armenian Christian to leave his suburb and go
into the bazaars in Isfahan on a wet day. “A
wet dog is worse than a dry dog.” Nevertheless,
there are great differences of opinion on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
point, and most non-clerical Shiahs would take
tea at any European’s house. There was a
Shiah woman who used to freely take tea at
the house of a Christian lady, the lady herself
making it and pouring it out, but she refused
to use the tea-glasses used in the same house
by Babi women. Another Shiah lent a donkey
for a Christian lady, but told her that he could
not use it again if she allowed her Parsi nurse
to ride upon it. And yet it is more easy to
get the Mussulmans to eat food with the Parsis
than with the Jews, whose religion ranks higher
than Zoroastrianism in the popular regard,
though they themselves are specially despised
by the Mohammedans. This curious mixture of
breadth and bigotry is only explicable on the
assumption that the Shiah’s main ideal is exactly
that opportunist position which was taken up
by Mohammed during his lifetime.</p>

<p>Perhaps we ought not to leave this subject
without discussing rather more fully the assertion
which has been made about the Persian Shiahs,
that they have changed the doctrine of the unity
of God for a loose pantheism, and have dethroned
the Quran for the utterance of Sufi poets. That
the Persians as a race have an extreme veneration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
for Sufi poetry, which contains expressions of
questionable orthodoxy, cannot well be called
in question; but before discussing the more
serious part of the allegation, it is necessary to
thoroughly understand about whom it is stated;
for there are small Shiah sects, of whom it is
quite true that they are only half Mussulman,
but these are very different from the sect which
is at present predominant in Persia, and which
in Yezd at any rate does not appear to lack
veneration for the Quran. One point, however,
must be granted, and that is, that all Persian
Mussulmans, orthodox or otherwise, are often
led to express acquiescence in a statement which
appears to be in itself correct, however opposed
it may be to the general tenor of their other
beliefs. The fact is that they do not easily see
a contradiction, and this has made it possible for
the Shiah to accept poetry which he would otherwise
have absolutely rejected. I do not myself
know a single Christian doctrine to which I could
not get most Shiahs to agree, if I was careful to
state it in language with which they were familiar,
and not to dwell on its divergence from the
Mussulman idea.</p>

<p>But doctrines so allowed to pass, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Christian or Sufi, would have no strength against
the system of Islam, which most Yezdis have
grasped as an integral whole. The general plan
of Mussulman doctrine, constructed as it was for
inhabitants of a desert, is peculiarly comprehensible
to people like the Yezdis, who are accustomed
to isolated objects and ideas, and are slow at
grasping a too elaborately connected argument.
For the system of Islam is not elaborately connected:
that there is a general consistency in it,
is true, but the consistency is like that of a
certain housewife’s accounts, in which a large
number of items were entered under the heading
of “forgets.” The accounts were true and
accurate, but they were not highly instructive.
Similarly in Islam a large variety of commandments
have been labelled, “commandments for
the age of Moses,” or “commandments for the
age of Mohammed,” and the doctrine of the
<i>paighambari</i> is so formulated as to make further
systematisation unnecessary. This being a scheme
of arrangement which a Persian can understand,
it has laid hold of his mind to a peculiar degree.
Phrases and expressions that are opposed to it,
he will often accept, but their influence on his
behaviour is exceedingly small. The thing which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
dominates him, and will, unless explicitly resisted
and combated, always continue to dominate him,
is Islam and Islam alone.</p>

<p>Before going on to discuss in another chapter
some other important aspects of the Yezdi’s
religion, it will be well to consider how the
whole Mussulman theory has affected his character.
First of all, it has made him even more disposed
to unconnected and disjunctive views of life than
he would otherwise have been. This becomes
plain when we compare him with his fellow-townsmen
who have been in touch with other
religions. Secondly, we find that he possesses
a very low view of the value of morality, which
in Mohammedanism has no unique place, but is
only one of the ways of attaining salvation.
Another way is through accuracy of religious
observance, and, when a Persian takes to this,
he generally abandons any attempt to live straight.
Residents in the country are well aware of this,
and are justly inclined to distrust a man who is
very particular about his prayers and ceremonial
duties.</p>

<p>I must ask the reader to pardon me if I have
said in this chapter anything which appears disrespectful
to Mohammedanism. In trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
record facts and to correctly weigh impressions,
one cannot avoid frankly stating what has been
forcibly brought before both mind and eyes, even
though the things stated may not be exactly
what they are expected to be. The fact is that
Islam has ruined Persia; and it is not fair to the
real character of the people to underrate the effect
that this religion has produced on them. As to
Mohammed, I believe that I have stated nothing
about him which is not a matter of common
knowledge. Doubtless the author who starts
with the determination to write an interesting
and sympathetic book, will be able, by selecting
his incidents, to convey a more favourable impression,
just as a criminal lawyer may be able
to find much in favour of even a guilty client;
but the historical critic who starts on the
examination of Mohammed’s history without any
pre-judgment must necessarily find it difficult not
to come to a very unfavourable conclusion. The
Arabian prophet headed a monotheistic movement
which had started without him, and which would
have probably succeeded to a very large extent
whether he had touched it or not, and to this
movement he did a great deal of damage without
making any serious ethical contribution. It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
be readily admitted that Mohammed was an
attractive person, and that he possessed other
great gifts, one of which was unusual eloquence.
He seems to have been an enthusiast who in
his worst moments absolutely believed in himself
and in his mission, and there is no doubt that
he drew into his company, both by persuasion
and violence, men who might have looked askance
at a more spiritual leader. But those who want
to know what Islam does for a people who accept
it had better compare the Yezdi Mussulman with
the Yezdi Parsi. The Parsis have a curious and
interesting religion, the main point of which
seems to be the belief that God has created all
things of the four elements, and that He therefore
expects from all His creatures a reverential
and sympathetic treatment of one another. The
religion is Gospelless, it is coated over with gross
superstitions, and it has the very great defect of
being so elementary in its teaching that there is a
strong tendency amongst its professors to deny
revelation altogether, and to become simply
rationalists. For all this the Zoroastrian Parsi
possesses, as a rule, a strong moral character,
which, when he becomes a Mohammedan, is almost
always lost in a few generations. Unfortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the Behāī movement is just now attracting a large
number of Zoroastrians, and is becoming a serious
danger; for the Behāī, whatever he may say to the
contrary, is really a Mussulman, and his system,
in which opportunism takes the place of the
doctrine of the growth of the moral law, retains
most of the more serious defects of Islam. However,
as the majority of the Yezdi Parsis are not
likely to become Behāīs, it is a matter for
congratulation that any European power that
may have to solve the problem of establishing
good government in Southern Persia will find
ready to hand a considerable community of this
intelligent and interesting people in at least one

<p>It is now necessary for us to touch on some
aspects of Mohammedanism in Yezd with which
it was impossible to deal fully while sketching
the essential system. In the last chapter we
were primarily dealing with the religious ideas
that had been brought to bear upon the country
as influences, but in this chapter we shall speak
rather more of their results. First of all, I should
like to give two stories. I give the two, because
one is the account of a conversation which I had
with a man who was not an orthodox Shiah; and,
although I fancy I have heard similar remarks
made by men whose orthodoxy was unimpeachable,
it is well to be on the safe side. I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
challenged to give my reasons for preferring
Christianity to Mohammedanism, and in reply
I gave an account of a conversation I had had with
another Mohammedan only a day or two before.
I had been trying to show him that lying was
a sin, and he had replied to me: “It’s all very
well for Ferangis to say that; but the fact is
that they can’t tell lies, and we can.” I quoted
this story simply as bringing out very forcibly
a common Persian idea, for Persians trust
Ferangis implicitly, not because they respect
them, but because they believe they have a
constitutional difficulty in telling lies. Having
quoted it, I went on to say that as we all
acknowledged in theory that truth-telling was
right, it was reasonable to infer that a religion
which had produced a mental constitution
supposed to be incapable of falsehood, was better
than a religion which had produced the exact
contrary. The answer of the Mohammedan was
that truth-speaking and honesty had nothing to
do with religion, but were purely a matter of
climate. “In that case,” I said, “the people of
Persia ought to speak the truth very well, for one
of the Greek historians who lived before the
Mohammedan era declared that the Persians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
famous for speaking the truth.” “But who does
not know,” said the Mohammedan, “that the
climate of a country changes entirely every two
thousand years?”</p>

<p>At another time a Mohammedan of undoubted
orthodoxy was answering a similar position, only
he was trying to explain away not only the
difference in honesty, but also in other matters.
He said: “These facts cannot be denied, but
they prove the truth of Islam, and not its falsity.
If you find that thieves have broken the doors
and windows of a house, do you not conclude that
there is something worth stealing inside?” I have
reason to believe that this is a well-known retort,
for other Europeans in other parts of Persia have
been met by it. It is therefore well worth examination.
I myself find in it two assumptions
which seem to me to be peculiar features of Islam.
First there is the assumption that the possession
of the treasure gives no safety to the doors and
windows: that is to say that the possession of
true religion does not in any way assist the
keeping of God’s commandments. The fact is
that Mohammed’s commandment is not expected
to be a source of spiritual strength, but only a
set of orders. Then there is the equally un-Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
assumption that the keeping of the
moral commandments of God is in no sense the
treasure, but something entirely extraneous to it,
which is not essential to the state of the treasure-holder.
These two assumptions are to be found
running through the whole of Persian Islam, and
producing the most extraordinary results. Very
few Mohammedans will hesitate to acknowledge
the low state of Mussulman morality as opposed
to that of the Armenians, or even of the Parsis,
whom they regard as little better than idolaters.
If a Mussulman of the teacher class has anything
to gain by confessing or making it plain to an
infidel that he has been guilty of gross sin, he
will not consider that he has in the least forfeited
his claim to a superior position by doing so.</p>

<p>Of course being non-ethical the religion
becomes superstitious. The Mohammedan considers
that there is no known principle by which
the commands of the Deity can be connected and
understood, consequently he admits actions in his
religious code which we should regard as ridiculous.
The whole theory of Mussulman pilgrimages is
absurd, and the practice is even more so. What
can be more intrinsically foolish, as well as
heartless and cruel, than the custom of sending off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the old women, when they are past work, to some
holy shrine, under the impression that, if they die
on the very difficult journey, as in a certain class
of cases they generally do, they will go straight to
Heaven? It is rather a ghastly custom to send
vast quantities of bodies for interment in the
exceedingly inadequate space at Qum, over a
country where there is no vehicular transport.
But the natural demand for a more easy set of
roads to Heaven has caused a multiplication of
such practices as these far beyond anything that
was originally taught in the mosques. Things
have gone so far in this respect, that the most
popular edition of the Quran in Persia is a very
minute round one in two parts, absolutely illegible,
and only suitable for wearing in a sewn-up case.</p>

<p>As in most superstitious countries, we find a
number of superstitions connected with divining;
and these are largely sanctioned by the mullas,
who will divine with the Quran in a mosque for a
fee. The commoner form of divining is with a
rosary, rather on the plan of “Two, four, six, eight,
Mary at the cottage gate.” Persians use this to
an extent that is hardly believable. They will
consult the beads as to whether to send for the
doctor, and again, after he has come, to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
whether they should buy the medicine he
prescribes, and finally, after buying it, they consult
them once more before deciding whether the
patient shall take a dose. At the same time it is
quite permissible to “call threes.” A woman with
raging toothache got permission from the beads to
send for a European lady to extract the tooth, but
on taking the beads for the extraction after her
arrival they were unfavourable, so arrangements
were at once made for divining with the Quran at
a mosque, which would of course overrule any
result with the beads. A Persian will consider
himself quite justified in breaking a business
engagement if the beads tell him he had better
avoid the interview; indeed very often he will not
so much as fix a date for the payment of a bill
before he has consulted his almanac, and
discovered which are the lucky and which are the
unlucky days.</p>

<p class="caption">SANDY DESERT NEAR YEZD.</p>
</div>

<p>The vast empty deserts which surround Yezd,
and the huge mountain ridges which form the
horizon are to the Yezdi by no means empty. It
is an axiom of science that Nature abhors a
vacuum, and it is a corresponding psychological
law that the human imagination cannot tolerate
absolute emptiness. So the Yezdi, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Arabian, peoples his deserts with <i>jins</i> and <i>dīvs</i> and
devils, and wherever there is a space not filled in
he imagines strange forms of animal life. At the
risk of being considered superstitious myself I must
own that I should like to see some of the travellers’
tales of Persia more carefully investigated, particularly
those relating to the existence of very large
lizards which are dangerous to human life. One is
familiar with the defences that are being constantly
brought forward for the fable of the sea-serpent;
how that the sea is after all an almost unknown
waste, only crossed in a very few places by well
established water-roads that can be most easily
avoided; and although the desert cannot be said to
afford as much cover as the ocean, for it is not
possible to plunge below the surface at any point
at any time, still its vast expanses are almost as
untraversed and unknown as the ocean wastes, and
there are not a few places, especially in the
mountains, honeycombed with caves and clefts.
This however is a digression. In such a country
as I have described, with its vast and barren
solitudes, it would be difficult for a people to exist
and maintain their reason, if they did not believe
in something corresponding to the <i>jins</i> and <i>divs</i>.
Consequently we find <i>jins</i> in the keyholes, <i>jins</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the <i>qan’ats</i>, <i>divs</i> in the mountains, <i>divs</i> in the rocks,
anywhere, everywhere, a vast population filling up
the huge interstices left by Nature. Most of this
population is malevolent; so naturally the ordinary
Persian is a mass of charms: nobody goes about
without cold iron in his pocket, and a large
number of people wear either the sacred book in
its entirety, or large portions of it somewhere
about their person. Also they are terribly afraid
of the evil eye; and numbers of their charms,
especially for the children, are directed against it.
It is not that they think the evil eye common: any
Persian will tell you that very few people have it,
but they all know of at least one case, and they
are terribly afraid of it, sometimes refusing to
admit strangers to their house until they are
satisfied they have not got it. If a mother sees a
dead body before the birth of her child, then,
unless she takes the precaution of placing some
salt on the corpse, and afterwards putting a little
of it in the child’s eye, her child will inevitably
have the evil eye, and everything that is pleasing
to its eye will be cursed. The evil eye is likely to
kill children of tender years, so very young
children are always hidden under the <i>chādar</i> when
carried in the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>These superstitions are exceedingly general,
and sometimes co-exist with a certain amount
of intelligence and education. I remember a
man who had obviously been in touch with some
of the Persian mystics, and was quite capable
of discussing and more or less understanding
complicated ideas, telling me that he considered
that the silkworm owners in the Yezd district
were exceedingly wise in refusing to admit
strangers to see the worms. He explained to
me that they were creatures of such extreme
harmlessness and guilelessness that they were
peculiarly susceptible to malevolent influences
from the outside world.</p>

<p>Superstitions of this kind will be found in
all countries, and in most lands there are in
addition superstitions that seem to be more
intimately connected with the religion. The
nature of the country fosters the tendency in
Persia, and the Parsis are nearly as superstitious
as the Mussulmans. But in Mohammedanism
the peculiar difficulty is that there is nothing to
guide a man in separating the superstitious
practices from any connected with a central
true idea. The whole religion is a medley of
trivialities. The history of Mohammed and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
early admiration for the Jews, with whom he
must have been constantly in touch, explains
this. He saw the result of their ceremonial
law and their national religious customs, binding
them together and making them a peculiar people
in every action of their household life; but of
the parabolic significance of this law, of the
doctrinal system which governed it, he saw and
was taught very little or nothing. Nor did he
want it: he wanted simply the political result,
and in getting this he was eminently successful.
He copied the system, but he gave to Islam a
maximum of ordinances containing a minimum
of teaching. After his death the minutiæ went
on accumulating, until everything in the life of
a Mussulman took a religious colour. In Persia
the very dress is supposed to be more or less
modelled on that worn by the prophet. The
people not only kill their animals and eat their
food according to the precepts of the Quran,
but relying on their very extensive traditions
they follow a prescribed religious practice in
attitude and language. Shiahs are particularly
scrupulous about certain of their washings, and
think almost as much about them as they do
about the regularity of their prayers. “If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
become a Christian, when and how am I to
wash myself?” This is one of the commonest
questions for an enquirer to put to a missionary.
Another very common one is, “How am I to
dress?” The Mussulman hardly understands you
if you tell him that such points are left to the
individual judgment. I remember a Persian
trying to prove to me that I could not possibly
consider all meats lawful and ceremonially clean,
or I should eat cat. It is very difficult to explain
to the Yezdi that the drinking of wine at meals
is not a necessary Christian institution, and for
this reason the consideration of the necessity of
maintaining Christian liberty is in Persia rather
an argument for total abstinence than against
it. In Yezd we are continually being asked
whether the commonest peculiarities of European
custom, such as eating with a knife and fork,
were ordained by Christ. In one house they
had to make away with some kittens, and the
servant was directed to dig a hole in the compound
for their reception. While he was doing so he
asked his mistress, “Did your prophet direct you
to bury kittens?” But the extreme point of
triviality was reached by a man who had seemed
a most intelligent enquirer, and had asked me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to explain the essential points of Christianity,
to which he listened most attentively, appearing
to weigh them in his mind. When I had finished,
he paused to consider the whole position: “<i>Sahib</i>,”
he said very slowly, “<i>man mas’ala dāram</i>.”—“Sir,
I have a religious question to bring before you.”
I said, “<i>Bifarmāyīd</i>.”—“Please proceed.” “<i>Āyā
Masīh</i>,” he said very deliberately, “<i>āvāz i sūtrā
halāl dānist?</i>”—“Did Christ consider humming
lawful?” I reassured him on the point, and
tried to explain the spiritual nature of Christ’s
teaching. I then left the room to get a book,
and, when I came back, he was humming to
himself contentedly.</p>

<p>Religion also provides the Yezdi with his
entertainments and excitements; the place of the
theatre is taken by the Muharram miracle play,
and that of the ordinary concert by the <i>rūza khānī</i>
or religious recitation, while even street rioting
is generally connected with the persecution of
people who do not agree with the religious
opinions of the rioters. All this serves to
strengthen the attachment of the common people
to the religious system, which stands to them in
the place of country, standard of etiquette, habits
of life and code of cleanliness. As a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
fact religion is not quite the right term for the
Mohammedan system, for religion means restraint,
and the object of almost all of the other systems
called religions has been to present a predominant
idea which is to govern and restrain all other
ideas and aspects of life. In Mohammedanism
there is the predominant idea of the <i>tauhid</i> and
<i>paighambari</i>, but this conception more resembles
the central doctrine of a philosophy than the
governing principle of a religion. To put it in
other words, Mohammed sought by his theological
teaching rather to include everything than to
control everything. Consequently the Mussulman,
who reflects the spirit of his master much
more than is generally allowed, is never satisfied
with himself unless he is using religious language.
What he does matters comparatively little, but
the way in which he regards his action matters
a great deal. If he forgets to mention God’s
name, he corrects himself; but to his mind there
is little or no blasphemy in connecting God’s
name with any action of life, important or trivial,
good or bad. The result of this is that those
who are accustomed to religions possessing more
influence over moral action are amazed at the
religiosity of the Mohammedan: but although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
this religiosity is a fact, the whole wonder of it
ceases when the religion is carefully examined.
Others are equally astounded at what they
consider the hypocrisy of the Mussulman; but
this also is a misnomer: a Mussulman is not
hypocritical: rather he has taken up a position
towards affairs which renders hypocrisy unnecessary.</p>

<p>In Persia, at any rate, there is a further
mistake which ought to be guarded against.
Islam is not mere worldliness sanctified by the
use of religious terms: it includes a great deal
of unworldly thought, although it combines all
considerations, worldly or unworldly, with little
if any distinction. Still it must be owned that
the worldly considerations are apt to predominate,
for the Persian Shiah seems to be a reflection of
Mohammed, who suggested that pilgrimages should
be used for purposes of trade, invited people to
become Mussulmans for political reasons, and not
only winked at the making of converts by threats
and terrorism, but laid this down as one of the
essential means for spreading the religion. It is
not sufficient to call such a system politico-religious,
for it not only includes matters of public
expediency in the religious idea, but it also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sanctifies considerations of expediency that are
purely personal. Yet there is one thing that the
missionary in such a land as Persia cannot too
fully realise; and that is that he is dealing with
people who are not in the least ashamed of
doubleness of motive. In their view, two purposes
are better than one; and when it has been proved
that their purposes are worldly, it has still to be
considered whether there is not an unworldly
purpose as well.</p>

<p>Men frequently come to enquire about Christianity,
drawn by what seems to us a strange
mixture of motives. They naturally enough
put their more spiritual purposes first, for they
realise that these are most appreciated by those
to whom they talk, and they also consider that
things like this ought to have a theoretical
priority. Temporal needs are, however, much
more pressing, and these have just as much claim
to be satisfied by a new religion. Of course such
a position is likely to be fruitful, not only of the
gravest difficulties, but also of the most lamentable
misunderstandings.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that a system
like this can easily be made to cover ideas which
appear inconsistent, and as a matter of fact, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
very difficult to define some of the notions which
Persian Shiahs hold to a point of fanaticism. For
instance, there is room for considerable difference
of opinion as to how far the Yezdi regards the
foreigner as unclean. The Mohammedan is taught
to regard as unclean the eating of certain kinds of
food, contact with certain animals, and also contact
with the persons of people who have not been
ceremonially cleansed. There seem, however, to
be degrees of uncleanness. Mohammed in one
verse of the Quran declared the food of the
Christians and Jews, as well as all food that had
been properly prepared by a Mussulman, to be
lawful; but we cannot suppose that he regarded
these different classes of food as equally clean.
Bigoted Persians sometimes ignore this permission
of their prophet’s, and declare that it refers only
to dry food prepared by Jews or Christians; but
in this they are not consistent, for they eat dry
food prepared by pagans also.</p>

<p>The truth is that the attitude of the Persian
towards the infidel is not altogether decided by
Mohammed’s direct teaching, but to a very large
extent it is based upon an elementary human
feeling which can be found in almost every
country under the sun. Most people in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
have a physical shrinking from undue contact
with other persons. We do not care to drink
out of a cup that other people have used, until
it has been washed; we should, very few of us,
care to take alternate bites at an apple with
somebody else, and most Englishmen have a
very similar objection to kissing. We are much
less particular about contact with the hand, though
here also we feel that a line has got to be drawn
somewhere. Within the family we are less
particular. Of course in connection with these
things there is in England a great deal of talk
about infection and the laws of hygiene, but the
instinct exists apart from any notion of hygiene
at all. Now in Persia you have got to remember
that everything takes a religious colour, and this
has tended to slightly modify the natural instinct,
breaking down the wall of reserve within the
boundaries of Islam, and giving the feeling the
colour of a religious prejudice when applied to
the outside world. Of course there are hundreds
of Yezdi Mussulmans who will eat freely with a
European without the slightest scruple, and a still
larger number who do not allow their scruples
to make any practical difference: at the same
time people who wish to get into close touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
with the natives should remember that the feeling
of <i>nijāsat</i>, or ceremonial uncleanness, is a somewhat
complex one, and that it will be more easy
to overcome it if a certain discretion is observed.
Persians eating the food of a European are on
the look out for anything which is strange and
peculiar, and if such peculiarities are observed
they naturally feel more strongly the difference
between themselves and their host. This not
only renders them less approachable, but it also
makes them much more shy of adopting Christian
ideas, and in the case of enquirers, who, as I
have said before, find it very difficult to understand
that our customs are not all regulated by religion,
a feeling may grow up that the state of Christianity
is not possible to a native Persian.</p>

<p>As this book is not about Mohammedanism
but about the Yezdi, I have perhaps devoted
as much space to the religion of Islam in Yezd
as is warranted by my choice of subject matter.
At the same time there is no doubt that I have
left out a great deal that might have been said,
even without going into those details of doctrine
and practice which it has been my intention to
avoid. I have tried to give some idea of what
Islam means to ordinary people in an ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Persian town, and I have had to dwell rather
more at length on points where there was danger
of misconception either through too precise a
study of the accurate doctrines of Islam, or
through a too superficial view of the result. In
doing this I fear that I may have passed over too
rapidly the more familiar aspects of the religion,
the intense excitement of the spectators and
actors at the Muharram games, the mourning
for Hasan and Husain, the frenzied fanaticism of
the mob after a rousing sermon at the mosques,
and the close adherence of many Mussulmans
to washing and prayers. This is one side of
Shiah Islam, but as it is better known I have
attempted to give the other. I cannot, however,
leave the subject without reminding those who
have to do with Persians of two most important
things; first, that there is a real spiritual seeking
amongst Mussulmans, and that the presence of
worldly motives does not preclude it; secondly,
that there is real enthusiasm for their religion
in spite of latitudinarian ideas. To the Mussulman,
as has been before stated, the system of
Islam is everything, and he clings to it as dearly
as to life itself, for it represents to him every
habit that he has formed, and its cause is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
cause of every motive that he acknowledges to
be possible.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The religious ceremonies which in Persia arouse the greatest
enthusiasm and fervour are essentially Shiah. The yearly
miracle play in the month of Muharram depicts the death
of the Imam Husain, son of Ali and Fātima, and grandson
of Mohammed. This is the occasion of the most violent
exhibitions of emotion on the part of both players and
spectators. Men lash their naked bodies with chains in an
ecstasy of frenzy, and the whole crowd bursts into groans
and tears of grief. Feeling runs so high, and becomes so
unmanageable on these occasions, that the secular authorities
have tried to keep the performances out of the larger towns.
But the atmosphere which is created is not by any means
anti-foreign in a general sense. The Imam Husain was
done to death by his co-religionists, and tradition reports
that a Ferangi ambassador interceded with Yazīd for the
martyr’s life. This ambassador appears in the play, and
Persians often try to borrow an English saddle for his
horse from the European residents. At the performance
at the big village of Taft, which is near Yezd, I think the
ambassador was often dressed as a modern Englishman, but
I cannot vouch for this. At Yezd itself, the miracle play
was not acted; but the carrying of the Nakhl, a ceremony
supposed to be fraught with the same kind of danger, took
place yearly. The Nakhl is a huge wooden erection hung on
one side with daggers, and on the other side with looking-glasses.
There are several Nakhls in Yezd, and two are very
large. This custom also is connected with the death of
the Shiah martyrs. The Nakhl is supposed to be moved
from its place in the square by the miraculous agency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Fatima; but a good many people take it on themselves
to assist her. Lastly, there is a night set apart for the
burning of Omar, the usurping Khalif, and the carrying
of the effigy through the town is the occasion of extreme
excitement. One cannot help being strongly reminded of
Guy Fawkes’ day in England. Omar, it must be remembered,
is a Sunni saint.</p>

<p>If it were not absolutely essential to the purpose
of a book like this that there should be a more or
less detailed analysis of the character of the Yezdi,
I should certainly shirk making such an analysis.
The Yezdi’s faults are numerous, glaring, and
interesting. His virtues are not only fewer, but
there is much less to be said about them. In the
concrete man, these virtues show fairly prominently,
the vices have their peculiar humour, and
the whole is not unlovable. On paper, while
discussing the different points of the Yezdi’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>

human being.</p>

<p>When one first becomes acquainted with the
Yezdi, one is inclined to regard him as so
inconsistent in matters of morals as to be utterly
devoid of all principle, bad or good. There is the
same uncertainty about his actions that there is
about the fall of an unloaded die. But just as
the fall of the die is regulated by the law of
averages, so the actions of the Yezdi are more or
less consciously decided by what can only be
termed systematised inconsistency, a kind of law
of balance which seems to him to possess the merit
of a principle. When he has done a certain
number of good actions, which it must be
confessed is frequently the case, then it is time for
him to do some bad ones; and <i>vice versâ</i>, when he
has done enough bad ones, he comes back for a
time to good ones. This is partially the result of
the theory of <i>savabs</i>; and the painful thing about
it is that it makes moral trustworthiness impossible.
If a man holds this pernicious theory as it was
sketched in a previous chapter, then the more he
has done right in the past the more he will feel
justified in doing wrong in the future; and this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Yezd is no mere nightmare, but the literal fact.
A good many of the Yezdis are frequently fair and
straight in their dealings, but I do not know a
single Mussulman among them, with regard to
whom it would be fairly safe to depend on his
doing the right thing on any particular occasion
simply because he knew it to be right. There are
men whose ordinary habits are fairly good, but to a
man who considers that derelictions of duty can be
absolutely paid for by past or future acts of merit
not necessarily involving very much trouble, the
temptation to yield to slightly increased pressure
is very strong, and is likely to frequently overcome
the bias of habit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Persians have very strong
notions of loyalty both to causes and to individuals.
Nothing has brought this out more than the
history of the Babi movement, which has certainly
exhibited the strength of Persian character. Boys
and young men have in this movement willingly
undergone the most terrible tortures in the service
of their spiritual teachers and the common cause.
It ought to be understood that the motives of the
Babi martyr are not quite the same as those which
have generally influenced the Christians who have
died for their faith. The Christian martyrs have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
generally died rather than do some act which they
felt to be sinful, or leave undone something which
they regarded as essential. A large number of the
Babi martyrs on the other hand have died because
they chose not to deny their faith, which according
to their tenets was perfectly permissible to do.
Now I know of at least one man, a Persian of high
position, who was killed as a Babi, but who would
have preferred embracing Christianity. What was
his connection with Babiism I cannot say: he
would, I believe, have embraced Christianity had it
not been that he shrank from a religion where a
direct denial of one’s faith must always be
accounted sinful. Whatever he was, he certainly
did not shrink from making his divergence from
orthodox Islam dangerously plain, and in this way
he met his death. My purpose in mentioning the
fact is to show that it is most difficult to induce
a Mussulman to accept a very hard and fast
line. Of course the story is only an illustration
and does not prove the point, because there must
have been other considerations which made
Babiism, or a degree of unorthodoxy which passed
for Babiism, easier to such a man than Christianity.
It is not necessary to suppose that he was only
influenced by a dislike to unbending rules; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the inability to ever deny his faith might have
exposed him to petty insults, which would have
been to him worse than death. Also his position
as a Christian would have been, humanly speaking,
a more solitary one. Still, when all has been said,
I am convinced that the constitutional dislike to a
hard and fast rule played at least some part in
bringing the man to his decision, and also that this
dislike is more pronounced in the Mussulman
Yezdi than in the Yezdi Parsi.</p>

<p>A Persian who attaches himself to an individual
will often prove himself very trustworthy in all
matters affecting that individual’s interest; and
generally speaking, attachment to a European
would be likely to produce a more dependable
loyalty than attachment to another Persian. The
feeling that a European friend would always himself
act in a certain manner frequently leads a
Persian to try and act in the same way towards
him. I remember a Persian servant once replying
to my wife, who had expostulated with him on
the subject of some egregious falsehood that he
had just told in the bazaars, “Of course, Khanum,
I don’t tell lies to you, for you don’t like it; but
these people expect me to lie, and one couldn’t
tell the truth to them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps one might go further, and say that
the Yezdi Mussulman frequently questions the
virtue of keeping to an abstract principle, particularly
when by abandoning it one might do a good
turn to a friend. Impartiality is a thing which
he absolutely fails to understand: indeed he
considers it simply another name for disloyalty,
and here it is probable that most other Easterns
would agree with him.</p>

<p>It is impossible to treat the inconsistency of
Yezdi Mussulmans as simple weakness. It is
rather the absence of such principles as Westerns
generally possess than the inability to keep to
them; and indeed it is often the result of other
principles of a peculiar kind, diametrically opposed
to those to which we are accustomed. The Yezdis
are a free-handed folk, and they despise a man
who does not spend freely. They like to appear
to live up to their incomes, and I think that some
of them have a feeling of the same kind about
their debit and credit account with their Creator.
Also we must not forget that Persian inconsistency
is not always a deviation towards wrong,
but equally often a deviation towards right.
Though in Persia it is never well to trust to a
man’s character, it is always advisable to appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to high principles, even when dealing with
apparently the most abandoned. While we were
in Yezd we were brought into contact with three
men in high position, whose names it is not
necessary to mention, but whom I would put
down as the three worst prominent men in Yezd.
The first was an aristocratic official, the second
a cleric, and the third an official and a <i>nouveau
riche</i>. Now each of these three at some time or
other made himself conspicuous by conduct that
one was bound to commend and approve. It is
impossible to always analyse motives, but in at
least one case the action seemed to have been due
to nothing but a disinterested and unselfish
impulse. In the other cases it is more probable
that expediency, or a conscious intention of paying
for sins by <i>savabs</i>, entered into the matter.</p>

<p>To trace this peculiarity of the Yezdi’s character
to its source is not easy. Sometimes it appears to
be a species of hedging, for it is very difficult to
find out the truth in Persia, and a general disbelief
in everything may have led the Persian to
feel that it is unsafe to stake his all on one
theory of the universe. The amount of lying
that is done in a town like Yezd baffles description.
An Englishman when in doubt tells the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
truth. A Persian when in doubt tells a lie.
This would be more tolerable were it not that
a Persian is always in doubt. In Yezd security
is a thing unknown, and telling lies becomes part
of the instinct of self-preservation. Then again
the lies are of a new kind. Lies in England are
generally told to deceive people in some particular;
in Yezd they are just as frequently told in order
to make the very search for truth impossible.
When I have had to examine into cases of petty
theft amongst schoolboys, I have found that to
get at the truth is an almost superhuman task.
English boys, if they do not tell the truth, will
at least tell as few falsehoods as possible, if for no
other reason, to avoid being found out. Persian
boys will not only lie on the subject they wish
to conceal, but they will tell as many untruths
as they can cram into the story, so as to render
any attempt at investigation futile. Of course
you know that they are lying, but, as they never
imagine that you will suspect them of telling the
truth, they are not much deterred.</p>

<p>The result of this practice is that in the Yezd
bazaars, taking together all statements, even the
most trivial, that are made by Mussulmans,
probably not less than one-third of the speeches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
made are falsehoods. I do not think that the
Persian beggar ever expects to be believed. A
woman once came to the house, asking for a quilt
because she had none, and her son was ill. To
have no quilt, that is, to have no bed-clothes, is
by no means an unbelievable state of poverty,
and there is no doubt that the woman expected
to have her words taken literally. It transpired
that her son was quite well, but was taking
sanctuary to avoid being molested for a debt.
The woman had a perfectly possible quilt, but it
was old and patched. She actually brought it to
us the next morning, not to prove that after all
they were very poor, but to show that in saying
she had none she had spoken the truth. Another
woman once told me in the street, that she had
six orphan children and her husband was sick.</p>

<p>In a country like this it is not surprising that
evidence is at a discount, and that there are intelligent
people absolutely convinced that truth
is unknowable. A man who is accustomed to
act upon this theory in the ordinary affairs of life,
is naturally inclined to apply the same principle
to whatever religion or philosophy he possesses.
So we get men who are unwilling to stake everything
on anything in particular. If they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
previously assumed that it is most advantageous
to do what is right, then it is well to perform
just a few actions on the assumption that it is
more advantageous to do wrong. If they have
hitherto acted on the principle that it is better
to do what is wrong, then it is well not to put
all their eggs into that basket either. And indeed
I am inclined to think that many of the Yezdis
would apply the same philosophy to their non-ethical
ideas. If they have based most of their
opinions on the assumption that something is
true, it is well to base others on the assumption
that the same thing is false. This, of course,
sounds to us mere nonsense, but once grant with
many of the Yezdis that evidence is valueless,
and truth absolutely unknowable, and it at once
becomes an approximation to sense.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that some of my readers
may ask whether this last attempt to explain the
inconsistency of the Yezdis is to be taken seriously.
To say that I do not know is rather a weak confession,
but at the same time it is true. I certainly
do not pin my faith to it, yet it seems to be the
way in which the bewildering topsy-turvydom of
Persia is working. Never forget that the jokes
of W. S. Gilbert are the facts of Persia. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
instance, in an isolated place like Yezd, the laws
of supply and demand operate so peculiarly that
the ordinary custom of discount on quantity is
inverted; you will be able to get things usually
sold at three for a penny at perhaps thirty for
a shilling. There was a governor in Yezd,
certainly not more than twenty years ago, who
had men bastinadoed for walking in the bazaars
without treading down the heels of their slippers.
In such a country it is very difficult to say what
is in itself ridiculous and impossible. One can
only judge from evidence, which is, I think, in
favour of the theory I have just suggested as a
possible explanation of undoubted facts. At the
same time the unreliability of the Yezdi is
probably due to several causes, and there is one
of these causes about which one may speak with
less uncertainty. This is the piecemeal appreciation
of ideas and circumstances, which I have
already mentioned as the result of the impression
made on the Yezdi’s mind by the isolated objects
which continually surround him, and which is
probably heightened by a religion which was
constructed under circumstances very similar to
those of the Persian deserts.</p>

<p>Shame is the feeling of vexation consequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
upon the consciousness of having fallen below
an accepted standard of conduct, and where such
a standard is not to be found, shame does not
exist. Consequently the Yezdi, who has only
the faintest idea of a moral standard that ought
to govern his whole life, is not susceptible to
shame in this particular. He has, however, a
rather stronger idea of a general standard of intelligence
up to which he ought to live, so it is
often a greater deterrent to him to point out
that a certain action will be regarded as ignorant
or silly than to show that it is less moral than
his ordinary behaviour. He also possesses a very
keen appreciation of what he considers to be the
ethical proprieties of a particular occasion. We
must remember that what he lacks in breadth
of view he makes up for in power of concentration
on the comparatively small field of ideas that can
come simultaneously within the range of his
mental vision. For example, when European
missionaries have been in vain attempting to
simplify a most abstruse and metaphysical
doctrine by spreading it over several easy
steps, they sometimes find that the Persian mind,
though it utterly fails to grasp the simpler train
of reasoning, can without any assistance take in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the more difficult idea, so long as it is expressed
with sufficient brevity. In the same way the
Yezdi, who seems to have little or no sense of the
proprieties of a lifetime, will have an appreciation
of what is right and fitting on a particular occasion
stronger than that of the European. This is what
makes him so dignified at times and seasons, and
so undignified in his life. Although his sense
of propriety does not always work, where it does
work it is so far from being weak that to violate
it seems to give him a sensation that is near
akin to physical pain. You cannot make a Yezdi
apologise: if he has done an injury, he is quite
content to ignore it, or to assert that it has not
taken place, which is the ordinary substitute for
an apology in Persia: but the man’s sense of
shame is too great to allow him to confess to
such an action before the man he has wronged.
He has no objection to the man knowing what
has happened; but at the interview his denial
must be accepted or the injury ignored. This
is the only way in which he can submit to the
meeting.</p>

<p>The Yezdi has not a very fine sense of humour,
but he is easily amused. Perhaps it is worth while
to instance an occasion which occurred during our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
stay in Yezd when the natives seemed really
tickled. A certain Russian doctor resident in
the town, who had not a very complete and
accurate knowledge of Persian, wanted to use
bad language to his servant, who had in some
way offended him. As he knew no suitable
expressions he seized the dictionary and kept
looking them out one after another, and hurled
them at the unfortunate man’s head as fast
as this process would permit. This story was
retailed with very great appreciation by some of
the better class natives. I rather think it seemed
to them very much more funny than it does to
us, and this for two reasons. Persians have a
great respect for literature, including dictionaries,
and they would hardly understand their being
frivolously handled; also they are very particular
in adapting their language to the occasion, and
it would strike them as the height of absurdity to
abuse a servant in book language, as the doctor
must have done, unless indeed the Russian
publication he consulted contained real specimens
of colloquial abuse, which would have struck the
Persians as even more funny.</p>

<p>The story of Mulla Nāsiru’d Dīn and his mule
is a very fair instance of Persian humour at its best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The Mulla, who was a notorious wit, had sent
a mule to the market-place where such beasts
were sold. People were suspicious owing to the
Mulla’s reputation, but nobody supposed that he
would let himself down by sending an unsaleable
animal to the bazaars. So first of all someone
examined its forelegs, and got badly pawed; then
someone went to its hind-legs and got kicked;
next they looked at its mouth and got bitten;
finally they tried to put saddle-bags on to its
back, and it threw them off immediately.
Consequently when the Mulla strolled down
everyone laughed at him, and asked him if he
really expected anybody to buy it. “No, my
friends,” said the Mulla, “I never expected any
of you to buy it; but I wanted you to know
what I have to put up with at home.”</p>

<p>One of the things that is most difficult for
a European to tolerate in a Yezdi is his extraordinary
disregard of time. It is not only that
he does not care how long he takes over a thing,
one might tell story after story on this point,
but this is a malady common in the East. What
I was not prepared for was that he should have
no idea what time means. In Persia a clergyman’s
work consists more of seeing people in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
his own house, and less of visiting; but the great
difficulty in receiving visitors is that, if one wants
to see parties separately, a single reception is all
one can satisfactorily arrange in an afternoon.
This is what happens. Two parties send to ask
when they can see you, and you reply by asking
when it will be convenient for them to come.
Both messengers state with the most absolute
politeness that it makes no difference to their
masters when you say, and that they wish you
to choose the time. If you are wise you will
tell one party to come two hours after noon, and
the other to come at one hour to sunset, which,
supposing the sun to be setting at six, will be
five o’clock. They will both acquiesce, but you
will have to be ready to receive the party due at
two at one o’clock, and you must not consider
them late if they arrive at three. Similarly you
will prepare for the second party at four, and not
consider them late before six. But the probabilities
are that both parties will arrive at four,
the favourite visiting hour, having both decided
on that time before sending to ask you.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Another great difficulty is the Persian language.
Persian is a pretty language with an extremely
large vocabulary. What is more, every class of
Yezdi, that is, of the men, uses a very large
number of words. For all this it is almost
impossible to accurately define an idea, for the
language largely consists of synonyms, which
cannot be used indiscriminately, but must be
carefully selected according to the occasion.
Some of these synonyms really possess accurate
meanings, but if you choose your word according
to the sense you wish to convey, you talk bad
Persian. To give an illustration of this, suppose
in dealing with the Incarnation you desired to
bring out the Christian doctrine that God is not
only the Friend of man but also his close
Companion. I am quite certain that in ordinary
Yezdi Persian there is no sufficiently appropriate
term for “companion,” that could be applied to
God in such a way as to bring out your meaning,
without exposing you to a charge of irreverence.
As a matter of fact I once tried to convey this
idea in a Persian sermon, and was met with this
difficulty. I afterwards tried to get three or four
native Christians, one of whom was a teacher
of Persian, to suggest a possible word, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
only expression they could propose was the word
I had used.</p>

<p>The words one uses in a letter in Persian, even
for the commonest objects, are almost entirely
distinct from the words one uses conversationally,
and the words which one would use in an
ordinary prose history book are again different.
Then it is almost impossible to distinguish the
tenses; the true future is hardly ever used, consequently
the present and the future are indistinguishable;
and the preterite is frequently
used of action which was begun in the past but
which is still continuing. Lastly, the adjective
is generally indistinguishable from the substantive,
and the link between an adjective and the
term which it qualifies is the same as the sign of
the genitive. For instance the text, “This is My
beloved Son,” may be read in the Persian Bible,
“This is the son of My beloved” without the
slightest violence to the grammar; nor, indeed,
is there any obvious way out of the difficulty.
I have mentioned these peculiarities of language
because I think they are greatly connected with
the Yezdi’s inaccuracy of ideas, though which is
the cause and which is the effect is sometimes
difficult to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no situation in which the Yezdi is so
incalculable as that which seems to demand a
certain amount of daring. Sometimes the people
seem absolutely wanting in the power of taking
the initiative, and expect to be directed like
children. They have an aversion to killing
animals except for food, even when there is
danger to human life in allowing them to live.
One day an English lady asked why a dangerous
dog which had bitten several people was not
killed. The answer was, “If you tell us to kill
it we will do so, but not otherwise.” The fact
is no one minded killing the dog, but they
fancied the curse might lie with the initiator of
the movement. They will go on letting things
be, or allowing them to get more and more
dangerous, until they have accustomed themselves
to an amount of risk to incur which
would be accounted by a European mere foolhardiness.
In this they are largely influenced
by predestinarian notions. An English lady was
one day standing by an open tank in a Persian
compound, into which one of the children had
fallen that morning, and she remarked on its
extreme danger. “Yes,” said the mother, “I
have lost three children in that tank.” To build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
a small wall round such a tank would be in
Persia exceedingly easy. Perhaps the little
power of initiative that is left them by their
predestinarianism is destroyed by the insecurity
of the country. People get in the way of
making as few improvements as possible, and of
never exposing their capital more than they can
help. In fraudulent business, however, there is
a great deal of audacity, sometimes combined
with a good deal of ingenuity. They are exporting
at present to China a quality of so-called
opium in which there is absolutely no morphia.
The stuff is really an entirely different substance,
and very cheap, and it is tied up in bags steeped
in a solution of opium. It is, I believe, more
harmful to smoke than the real article.</p>

<p>Passive courage the Yezdi possesses to a very
high degree, but he must have a cause for which
he cares sufficiently, if this courage is to be called
out. If the terrible Babi massacres that have taken
place from time to time in Persia have proved
nothing else, they have at least shown that
there is grit somewhere in Persian character. The
way in which mere lads in Yezd went to their
death in that ghastly summer of 1903 was wonderful.
There was one boy whom they tried very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
hard to spare, for sometimes the mob were
moved by something akin to pity. They took
him to the <i>mujtahid</i> first, and told him to
recant, and he would not. Then they took him
to the open square, and held him up to give him
one more chance, if he would curse the Behāu’llah
and the Behāīs. “The curse be on yourselves,”
was all he said; and then they tore him in pieces.
The early Babis showed good fighting qualities
in the north of Persia, as well as passive courage,
and, as they were chiefly townsmen, we may
presume that there are military possibilities in
the Persian people, even amongst those who
dwell in cities. But to look for military feeling
in the kind of soldier that we get in Yezd is not
fair. He is, I believe, collected by a sort of conscription
from certain localities. When collected he
is taught about as much of the ordinary elements
of drill as is considered necessary in England
for the national schoolboy. He is also assigned
a wage of a <i>toman</i> a month, which if punctually
paid would be insufficient to cover anything but
the barest food expenses. This mistake is, however,
generally remedied by his superior officers,
who usually intercept so much of his wages that
he is bound to look for other means of support.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
In this he is not discouraged. If he has a little
ready cash he usually sets up as a money-lender,
his official position and possession of a bayonet
assisting him to collect his debts. Otherwise he
steals shoes, or takes up some other similar form of
employment which does not demand an extensive
capital; sometimes he even makes shoes. Once a
year he is supposed to be supplied with a uniform,
but, though the uniforms are probably not worth
more than a few shillings, they are very seldom
regularly supplied. He is, however, free to add
to his uniform as well as to his pay, and at certain
times of the year there is very little left of the
original outfit except an old cap with a metal
badge, and possibly a belt. When on sentry
duty he amuses himself by planting a small
garden, four inches by two, in front of his
station, and he keeps a heap of rose-heads to
press into the hands of passers-by on the chance
of extracting odd halfpence.</p>

<p>During the latter days of the Babi massacres, a
guard of four men, a sergeant and three privates,
was placed at the doors of the European houses by
the Governor. Every soldier came to us with a
thing that looked like a gun and certainly had a
bayonet attached to it; but we heard that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
one house it became necessary to send down an
extra weapon which would shoot for the common
use of the party. Of course the gun that would
shoot was withdrawn at the earliest possible
opportunity. The higher officers of this extraordinary
force are surprisingly numerous, but as
there are among them, I believe, boys of about
twelve who hold the title of Field-Marshal, there
is some excuse for a reduplication of officers. It is
only justice to add that some of these soldiers are
in their way very good fellows: the guard sent
to our house were by no means a bad lot; and I
shortly afterwards met a military officer whom I
would class with the best Persians I know.</p>

<p>Nor does the courage of Persia come out very
strongly in the high official class, though here too
there are honourable exceptions. Still, as a general
rule, amongst those who claim nobility there is
very little apprehension of the maxim “<i>noblesse
oblige</i>.”</p>

<p>Of course there is in Yezdi manners and
customs much that strikes the outsider as intensely
funny. For instance, the etiquette is distinctly
peculiar, and although very ceremonious, it does
not always appear to the European to be
characterised by great politeness. When you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
come into the room the first two minutes will be
spent in phrases intended to convey an exaggerated
respectfulness. In upper middle-class houses your
host will take upon himself the menial offices of
service, not only making your tea himself, but
going out of the room every two minutes to
supplement the crockery, or to fetch another lump
of sugar. If you have a servant with you, your
host or his other visitors will discourse freely with
this man before your face as to your most trivial
personal affairs, and if there is a pause in the
conversation they will make side remarks to one
another on the number of your virtues, and when
they have discovered a certain consensus of
opinion, they will turn to you and give you the
benefit of it directly, by telling you that you are
a very good man. From this you must not infer
that Persian friendliness is hollow: all that can
be said is that the etiquette is artificial. Even
so it means something; for when a man is anxious
to pay you proper respect he adheres to it closely,
unless he has reason to suppose that you would
like him to adopt something of European manners,
which some Persians dealing with Europeans try
to do. However the etiquette is too elaborate
and artificial for universal use, and generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
speaking it is not much used except in matters
relating to visits and to letter-writing. On other
occasions Persians who have no intention of
impoliteness are often a little off-hand as compared
with other Easterns, and those who intend
to be rude find plenty of opportunities for being
so.</p>

<p>There is, I suppose, between the Persian and
the European a difference of opinion as to what
constitutes puerility. One of the Governors of
Yezd once boasted to an English resident that
it was no good trying to hide things from him,
as he knew what every European in the town
had for dinner. Then there is the custom of
making absolutely worthless presents with the
most superb <i>empressement</i>. Once when I was
in a big village near Yezd with my wife and
baby and mirza, a woman whom my wife knew
came in, and after greeting us presented us with
four very crumpled lettuce leaves, selecting the
leaves according to her ideas of our exact precedence
with the utmost care and circumspection,
and having in the whole transaction very much
the air of a maiden aunt giving a tip to a schoolboy.
Nor must it be supposed that these customs
only obtain amongst the women. A European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
banker once told me that if one of his brokers
gave him anything, the others always followed
his example; and that once at the bank one of
them presented him with a rose-head, the second
at once plunged his hand into his pocket and
produced an old sweet, the third fumbled among
his treasures, and at last found something which
looked like a lump of gum. He could not quite
remember what the fourth presentation was, but
he fancied it was another sweet. Sometimes,
particularly in Parsi houses, presents of this sort
will be elaborately handed about, somewhat after
the fashion of a round game, everybody giving
something to everybody, and finishing with exactly
the same amount as they had at the beginning.
This game, however, is generally played on a
special occasion, and the presents of fruit and
sprigs of myrtle have a certain symbolical significance
which gives grace and dignity to the
performance. Of course the interchange of
presents which although trifling have a positive
value is one of the most striking features of
the social intercourse of Persia. This is a custom
which needs to be understood, and which soon
degenerates into extravagance, but essentially it is
a good custom. A higher value is always placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
on what are called <i>saughāts</i> or travellers’ presents,
and Europeans either travelling or residing in
Persia should remember that a certain number
of these will be expected of them. When a
Persian has done you a real civility, he feels
that to a certain extent he has introduced you
to his home, and any little European thing which
you may give him he takes as a graceful introduction
to your separate life, and he values it
from this point of view much more than would
be otherwise possible. The custom, however, has
its drawbacks; for it is the fashion in Persia
always to present anything which a visitor has
admired, and this becomes a peculiarly hollow
piece of etiquette. Occasionally big Persians in
dealing with inferiors use this custom as a means
of enriching themselves, but this of course is
exceptional.</p>

<p>When all has been said I think that we must
admit that for some reason or other the Persian is
willing to expend his energies upon things which
seem to us to be absolute trifles. This was
curiously illustrated on one occasion by one of the
Yezdi gentlemen who is supposed to have advanced
most in civilisation and culture. I was calling at
his house at the time, and he handed me a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
elaborate atlas with charts and diagrams illustrating
all sorts of out-of-the-way things. Some of these
I did not feel myself competent to explain, but
everything that I could explain he understood at
once, and he had obviously before my arrival
discovered the meaning of many of the diagrams.
We passed on from this to discuss several of the
great inventions of the age, including wireless
telegraphy. In everything he showed a most
intelligent interest, and great quickness of
perception. Finally, he produced a photograph
of a man who had been shown at an exhibition,
I think at Paris. The man had an enormous
beard, some twelve feet long. My Persian friend
made no difference at all in his manner, but
discussed this peculiar phenomenon in exactly the
same way. I cannot remember all the details of
this interview, or the exact amount of smile
which my host allowed himself when we were
discussing the photograph, but I have attempted
to faithfully convey the general impression left
on me by his manner. I think I am right in
saying that it all points to the fact that the great
difference between Persia and Europe is that the
Persian tends to take things piecemeal, and the
European to regard ideas in their relation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
others. At the same time this is not always at
once obvious. A European is firmly convinced
of the value of scientific knowledge, and will
decorate a man who has discovered all that is to
be discovered about a black beetle. Here the
Persian will laugh at the European, as he also
will when the European rewards highly extreme
excellence in the practical trivialities of life.
But it is obvious that these exceptions are more
apparent than real. The Persian is like a man
who has got a pair of glasses that give him a
very clear view of a very small field of vision.
He does not view things absolutely piecemeal,
but he generally regards only a very small area
at a time. A man who picks up shells with an
idea of adding to the general store of human
knowledge is to him an imbecile; but he is
only willing to pay the same attention to an
invention like Marconi’s that he would to an
improved hair-wash. The consequence is that
the Yezdi very soon adapts himself superficially
to circumstances, and it is very easy to veneer
him, but he does not easily assimilate fresh
principles of action. In dealing with Persians it
is well to realise this, and not to build too much
on their adaptability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>A Persian visitor, when he is behaving
according to strict etiquette, depreciates not
only himself but all his belongings. It has been
suggested that the admiration which is frequently
expressed for foreign customs and ideas is really
due to this etiquette, and similarly that the
belittling of Persia as a country that has gone
to pieces is due to the same cause. This
suggestion is, I believe, entirely incorrect. A
Yezdi will belittle himself, his house, his relations,
and the country of Persia, because he regards
the first three as purely personal, and does not
care the least bit about the fourth; but if he
belittles his town, his etiquette, or the foundations
of his creed, he will make it very plain that he
expects you to understand that he simply does
it out of civility. There is one thing that a
Yezdi puts before everything, and that is the
water-supply of his town. I personally got on
very well with the Yezdis, although I had to
own that I did not admire Mohammed or his
religion. But another European, who openly
stated that he did not approve of their water,
succeeded in absolutely alienating their affections.
These exceptions show that Yezdis are willing to
exhibit their pride in what they really love. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
are also very proud of their literature, their
language, and their intelligence. As a matter
of fact, considering their extreme ignorance, they
are not a conceited people, and their willingness
to adopt foreign things more or less points to
the same conclusion. Some of them, and these
are generally the most ignorant, are insufferably
conceited, but as a rule their comparative freedom
from this vice makes them peculiarly likeable.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to a moral principle
that I can find amongst the Persians is their commendation
of simple acts of kindness. As I have
before mentioned the idea of <i>savabs</i> covers many
actions which have no ethical point, and it fails
to cover in the Persian mind many actions of a
moral character where the benefit is not at once
apparent. But Yezdis are brought up to admire
simple and direct acts of kindness, and to enjoy
doing them. Generally speaking, they are very
good-natured, and in nothing is this so obvious
as in their conduct towards children. Of course
cases of gross cruelty to children come to one’s
notice occasionally, but they are after all the
exception and not the rule, and the children
are more often spoilt by weak indulgence. The
Yezdi’s conduct towards animals very well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
illustrates his character. I believe that there is
less wanton cruelty, particularly towards wild
animals, than you would find in a European
town. On the other hand, the cruelty towards
working beasts is beyond description, there being
in this case an ulterior object. Again, the dogs
in the street, which are more or less under the
ban of the Mussulman religion, are treated in
the most extraordinary way. They are made
the recipients of little acts of good-natured kindness,
perhaps under the impression that a <i>savab</i>,
even to a dog, cannot do any harm, perhaps
because a Yezdi is often better than his ideas.
They are also treated on occasions with the most
fearful cruelty, and the cruelty in this case has
no point but the satisfaction of a religious prejudice.
This is, after all, exactly the way in
which the Yezdi Mussulman treats the human
being whom he considers unclean. He has
alternative principles which he chooses according
to his mood and circumstances. Sometimes the
prejudice against killing animals gives rise to very
great cruelty. It is generally considered a sin
to kill an animal except in self defence or for
food, but you may do anything to it short of
extinguishing life with your own hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up, in the case of offences against the
person Yezdis have an inkling of an ethical
principle, which is frequently at issue with the
more explicit teaching of their religion. This
seems to me to be one of the most hopeful
points in Persian character, and one which the
missionary ought to most carefully study, trying
to make it in many cases the basis of his appeals.
But we have to beware of trading too much upon
this very rudimentary principle. When we come
to offences against property, we shall find it applied
much less frequently, and working with much
less force. There is no inclination to honesty in
a Mussulman’s character to correspond with the
inclination to kindly action. If you want to
find anything of this kind you must go to the
Parsis. On the contrary, there is nothing that
gives the Yezdi Mussulman such intense satisfaction
as the feeling that he has scored by his wits.
He would much rather steal one <i>kran</i> than earn
two by the same expenditure of effort. A certain
amount of dishonesty is recognised, and is not in
any way resented. The servants, for instance,
expect to make a certain profit upon all transactions.
The extent of their profit is by custom left
entirely to the conscience of the servant, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
everybody would confess that taking more than
a certain amount was wrong. You will frequently
catch less trustworthy servants trying to make
over fifty per cent., and sometimes over a hundred.
As to the morality of this custom when the lowest
possible percentage is drawn I can only say that
I am not wholly convinced, as it appears to me
that servants who are trying to live a straight life
never ask for it to be sanctioned, and sometimes
certainly give it up, at any rate in its direct
form. But the point is that wages are generally
arranged on a scale that allows for a man taking
very much more than the minimum percentage.
Nor is this sort of allowance for dishonesty only
made in servants’ wages. One day the cook of
one of the Europeans went to the bazaars for
meat, and after the usual haggling the price was
fixed at twelve <i>krans</i> a <i>man’</i> (thirteen pounds),
“But,” said the cook, “you have got your thumb
on the scale.” “And do you think,” retorted the
butcher, “that I am going to give you meat at
twelve <i>krans</i> a <i>man’</i>, unless I keep my thumb on
the scale?” This shows you something of Persian
business principles, and indeed trickery is regarded
by all Persians as part of the ordinary routine of
life. Our servant once asked the milkman if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
could sell us some cream, and the man replied
quite gravely, “No, if I take off the cream they
will complain of the milk.” He obviously thought
that the natural way to supply us with cream
would be to skim the milk he sold us.</p>

<p>Passing to the merchant class the opium trade
affords a good instance of the most barefaced
type of wholesale fraud. Indeed, the fraud of
a Persian town is beyond conception. We had
a neighbour in Yezd who was considered a fairly
respectable man, and whose sole business was
the forging of seals. But the fact is that every
class, from the highest to the lowest, is thoroughly
permeated by the leaven of dishonesty.</p>

<p>There is so little security for property in Persia
that men do not consider it worth their while to
amass wealth by ordinary means. Everybody in a
town like Yezd is trying to effect a <i>coup</i>, either a
big one or a small one, and one of the results is
the most extraordinarily rapid shifting of social
positions. In Persia the road from beggary to
princedom is a very short one, and the road from
princedom to beggary is not very lengthy; only in
this return journey it is somewhat difficult to prevent
being assassinated, for when a big man is
disgraced his life is in extreme danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>This inattention to ordinary and petty business
enterprise has curious results. When I first went
to Yezd I found it almost an impossibility to
get the things I wanted from the bazaars. The
European has to deal with the bazaar through
his servants, and it took my men about three
days to get the commonest articles other than
necessary provisions. Articles which I knew
would need a little hunting for were sometimes,
if I insisted, procured within the month. This
is absolutely without exaggeration; and, although
I believe I was unfortunate, other residents and
travellers in Persia have confessed to similar
difficulties. You may go into a town where the
chief occupation is weaving, and declare that you
want some of the woven articles which it is their
principal business to make, and it is very possible
that you may be unable to procure them, or only
able to get the most inferior specimens, if you are
passing through quickly. This is rather less true
of the larger places on the main roads, like Tehran
and Isfahan, but in towns like Yezd there is the
greatest difficulty in getting what you want.</p>

<p>In an emergency it is frequently almost impossible
for a European to get what is needed,
if the things required are not such as he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
accustomed to buy at other times. To offer rather
more than the price one usually gives is not of
much use, and frequently has the very reverse
effect to what is intended; for the seller in such
a case may decide to forego the profits of
legitimate trading for the chances of effecting
a <i>coup</i>. But the real difficulty is rather that the
retail trading of Yezd is totally devoid of ordinary
enterprise. When the trader moves out of the
ordinary rut of his every-day commerce he
prefers to be fraudulent. In his customary business
the shop-keeper makes a fair profit, and
although his dealings may not be very extensive,
there is always the chance of something really
good coming his way. Meanwhile he has a
position very much more dignified than that of
the English shop-keeper. In Yezd the seller, not
the buyer, is the conferrer of the benefit, and so
far as the relation is concerned, the superior.
When he sells very small quantities, he often
charges less than the usual price. When he sells
large quantities, he frequently charges something
extra. Europeans in an ordinary way have not
much difficulty in getting regular supplies when
they become well known, though they have to
pay more for them than the natives do. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Armenian also has to pay more than a Yezdi,
but less than a European. I am inclined to
think that the poorer natives suffer from the
difficulty of procuring on emergencies things
which they do not ordinarily buy quite as much
as ourselves, though probably the richer Persians
have more facilities. This is just one specimen of
the inertia of Yezd. In matters of transport one
is even more in the hands of other people. It is
extremely difficult to find transport at less than
three days’ notice, and one can seldom get
off on a journey within two hours of the time
arranged. During the journey there is the same
difficulty in controlling affairs. Under such
circumstances people naturally get a tendency
towards fatalism, and undue persistence even
gets to be regarded as a sin. Probably this has
some effect on the religious conceptions of the
people, for, if a man who sticks to his point is
not to be admired, it is difficult to understand
why we should consider unchangeableness of
purpose a necessary attribute of the Deity.
Whatever may be the orthodox doctrine of
Islam upon the subject, there is no doubt that
the Yezdi fails utterly to understand why there
should be any persistence or consistency in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
view taken by the Deity of human sin, for the
Yezdi himself would hardly feel justified as a
father, or person in authority, in taking a similar
firm stand. One of the consequences of this
doctrine is that weakness is hardly accounted a
sin at all. I remember two conversations with
Babi mullas in which this came out very forcibly.
They tried to argue that <i>taqīya</i>, that is, the
custom of denying one’s faith under the stress
of danger, was sanctioned in the gospels by the
story of Peter’s denial. I have also found other
Persians who have disputed the sinfulness of
Peter’s action, on the ground that he was the
victim of compulsion. But the most curious
suggestion with regard to the defensibility of weak
conduct was made by another party of Babi
mullas, who considered that the difference
between the forbearance of Christ towards His
enemies and the impatience exhibited by
Mohammed was fully accounted for by the
respective lengths of their ministries.</p>

<p>One finds the marks of this want of persistence
everywhere. I have seldom seen a tombstone
in Yezd that has been finished accurately, and
there is scarcely a building that has not got a
rough, unfinished corner. Similarly every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
who has seen a Persian carpet knows that the
design is almost always broken in at least one
place.</p>

<p>I suppose the <i>prima facie</i> conclusion is that
the Yezdi is the weakest of weak beings, but I
am very doubtful whether this conclusion is true.
Repose and weakness are two different things,
and although we seldom find the Yezdi putting
out his strength, the condition of the country
is hardly such as to rouse him. Certainly in
the sphere of morals the Yezdi’s religion gives
him very little inducement to a consistent life.
“The Light That lighteth every man that cometh
into the world” is not wanting in Persia. Sometimes
it makes Mussulmans superior to their creed,
but, if I may be allowed to express an opinion,
I think this Light operates more in calling men
out of Islam than in guiding them in it.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I should
hesitate to make a similar statement about the
Parsis. It is not my intention to discuss Zoroastrianism
at length, but although it is a religion
without a gospel, almost all the essential ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
about God, and right and wrong, and the bases
of human action are undoubtedly true so far as
they go.</p>

<p>If one wants to know whether the Yezdi
Mussulman is strong or weak, one must examine
his conduct when he is sure of his cause. I think
he is worthy of some praise for the self-restraint
he habitually shows when he is conforming to
the by no means easy restrictions of an established
and elaborate etiquette. But, as I have previously
said, the thing which has opened people’s eyes
to the enormous strength of Persian character
under partially favourable moral conditions, is
the way in which the Babis have exposed themselves
to martyrdom, and have stood firm to
their beliefs and cause under tortures too horrible
for description. It has been mentioned that,
although Yezdis, while they remain Mussulmans,
do not show any great enthusiasm for a distinction
between right and wrong, they still possess the
greatest powers of loyalty both to causes and to
individuals. In their affection for those for whom
they care they are anything but weak, and when
they really attach themselves to Christianity and
realise the personal presence of Christ, they
develop an unexpected strength of character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
We must, however, beware of expecting an utter
change of constitution to take place at the time
of conversion.</p>

<p>A Yezdi’s personal attachments do not run
so closely along the lines of duty and relationship
as might be expected by people coming to Persia
from other Eastern countries. The family tie
is not always a very strong one, though it is
sometimes exceedingly strong. Perhaps one
reason for this is the extreme looseness of
matrimonial relations. A Shiah may have four
regular and permanent wives. When he marries,
a settlement is made on the woman, who may be
divorced at any time if he cares to pay the settlement.
The woman may also divorce her husband,
if she cares to forfeit the settlement, that is if
she is sufficiently mistress of her own movements
to be able to make the necessary arrangements.
There is no limit to the number of divorces and
re-marriages, so long as no man possesses at any
time more than four wives. Besides these he
may have as many temporary wives as he likes.
It is true that these wives are theoretically only
slaves, but this, after all, is simply a legal quibble.
They can be married either for a few days or for
a few years. Babis may only have one wife, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
divorce is discouraged, though amongst the less
respectable Babis in Yezd divorce is as common
as anywhere. Some of the more respectable
Mussulmans in Yezd openly profess a belief that
monogamy is the more respectable state, and
among the better Yezdi merchants it is very
common. Girls are sometimes married extremely
young, for instance at nine or ten, but there is
a growing feeling that to marry a very young
child is not altogether respectable, and some of
the better class merchants prefer not to let their
girls be married before fourteen. Of course this
is an unsatisfactory state of things, but one must
not fly to the conclusion that there is no affection
in Persian marriages. One of the missionaries
had a lad of about eighteen in his employment,
and there had been talk of a marriage between
him and a child of ten or twelve. Going home
one evening for his night off, he found that he
had landed in the middle of his own marriage
ceremony, which took place that night. He was
a good-natured lad, fond of children, and the
little wife was devoted to him and was terribly
distressed at his not coming home the next night,
for she had got everything ready for him, and
would not believe he was not coming. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
one of the ladies from the missionary’s house went
to call on her some days after she came very
close up and whispered that she wanted her
husband to come home every night.</p>

<p>The women of the highest official class are
kept very close in Yezd, perhaps only going out
once in six months, except to the bath; but the
merchants’ wives have considerably more liberty,
and the commoner women go about freely.
Sometimes there is a great deal of real affection
in the home, at other times exceedingly little,
especially when there is more than one wife, and
sometimes there is the grossest cruelty. The fact
is that Persians are led by impulse in these
matters. They are very slightly constrained by
any feeling of principle. As a class perhaps the
old mothers are the worst treated, and an old
woman generally prefers going to her daughter
rather than to her son. One of the richest
merchants in Yezd had an old mother who
was very ill, and he refused even to buy a
chicken to make the broth the doctor had
ordered. At last a favourite black slave wheedled
one out of him, and made the broth for the old
woman. Slaves in Persia are very valuable and
are generally well treated. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
another well-known merchant and landowner,
whose old mother-in-law was very ill, thought
nothing too good for her; he insisted on her
having all she wanted promptly, and came
himself to her room at least once a day to
enquire after her health. The same man took
a personal interest in seeing that every provision
was made for the comfort of his old cook when
she was past work, and the general tone of the
household was one of affection and consideration.
Another big merchant, whose old mother had
fallen off a roof, showed the very greatest
solicitude for her comfort in every possible way,
spending hours with her, and himself lifting her
most carefully. At the same time the old women
as a class are not well treated, and in the better
class houses it is often difficult to distinguish
them from the servants. The poorer classes are
generally no better. I remember that at one
time my wife was trying to explain to one of
my servants’ wives what ingratitude meant. The
woman was very fond of her children, so my
wife asked, “Would you not think it very
ungrateful, if, when you were old and poor, your
boy refused to do anything for you?” “No,”
she said, “of course that is what I expect. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
boys are always like that. We only say, ‘It
is the will of God.’” Several women present
joined in the laugh at my wife’s ignorance.</p>

<p>Of course a great deal of cruelty goes on in
the less respectable Persian households, and the
use of poison is not uncommon. It should be
explained that in Persia people who are not even
professedly respectable are to be found in every
class, and in a commercial town like Yezd status
goes largely by wealth, and carries with it no
obligation to keep up even a superficial reputation.
The organisation of the household is very largely
outside the operation of the ordinary law. I do
not know what is the exact legal limit of the
<i>jus paternum</i>, but I am quite sure that it is
very difficult to bring to book the head of a
household for murdering any member of his
family. Also in the case of a member of the
family leaving Islam, the matter would probably
be primarily left to the head of the household,
although if the case was flagrant the matter
might also be taken up by outsiders. It is very
necessary to understand this when discussing the
possibility of religious liberty in Persia. Religious
liberty, proclaimed by a firman of the Shah, would
not have the enormous value which is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
supposed. Indeed it would be almost entirely
without immediate value, unless the Persian
government were considerably strengthened, and
a limitation put on the <i>jus paternum</i>. A decision
by leading <i>mujtahids</i> that it was expedient to
give such liberty either to the individual or to
the family, would probably have more immediate
effect, but, even were such a thing possible, it
would be difficult to say how long such a decision
would remain unchanged if advantage was really
taken of it, and the precedent of the decision
would on the whole be rather a bad one.</p>

<p>Another conceivable form of religious liberty
is that the right of making converts from Islam
should be secured by treaty to the European
missionary. This, however, would not put a stop
to the persecution of converts. There is so much
injustice that is done in Persia as a matter of
course, that it would be very difficult to prove
that Persian subjects who were converts had been
interfered with for religious reasons. One of the
difficulties that missionaries experience at present,
is that converts are always bringing forward
instances of injustice which they themselves
believe to be due to their profession of Christianity,
whereas the missionary, who has considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
doubts on the subject, is often afraid of calling
down real persecution by using his influence on
their behalf.</p>

<p>The subject of religious liberty is a very
difficult one, and although some people feel that
an extension of treaty rights would be a good
thing, and others, that a firman of the Shah giving
religious liberty to his subjects would help the
growth of sound and civilised ideas in his domain,
there can be no doubt that the primary want is
strong and good government. I have tried in
this chapter not to discuss the government of
Persia more than is absolutely necessary. It is
of course far from perfect. At the same time,
during my stay in Yezd, the governors of the
town, and notably the Jalālu’d Daula, showed
great friendliness to the whole European colony,
and great fairness in their attitude towards the
mission. The strengthening of the Persian
government is a clear gain to the missionary,
and seeing that strong government without
religious liberty could certainly do for us infinitely
more than religious liberty without strong government,
I personally feel that the strengthening
of the Persian government, central and local, is
at present the main desideratum. At the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
time, with God all things are possible, and I
should hesitate to press this view on other people.</p>

<p>One or two instances of the lengths to which
crime can go in Persian houses without arousing
much notice from the authorities might be
recorded. There was in Yezd one man who
stabbed his own child in its mother’s arms, and
remained absolutely unpunished. He was still
flagrantly ill-treating his wife and children while
we were in the town. In the Isfahan district,
a man murdered his child-wife by pouring paraffin
over her and lighting it. The child died in the
Julfa hospital. If any punishment was inflicted
it was a very light one. There was another
woman in Yezd dangerously stabbed by her son-in-law,
but as she did not die, even her family took
very little notice of the matter. These are a few
typical specimens of the way in which the family
is allowed to manage, or mismanage, its own
affairs.</p>

<p class="caption">SQUARE OUTSIDE GOVERNOR’S RESIDENCE IN YEZD.</p>
</div>

<p>Generally speaking, Yezdis are open-handed.
They have not the least shame about begging,
and will show the greatest meanness in money-getting,
but this does not prevent their being
themselves generous at times. The fact is, that
they regard beggary as a bargain; one man gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a coin, and the other a <i>savab</i>. They accept
kindnesses of any sort in this manner, and consider
that they give as good as they get, particularly
if they are Seyids; but for all this, they are
frequently ready to take the other side in the
game. Probably not less than ten per cent of
the population are professional beggars, and as
they do not starve, we may conclude that a great
deal of money is given away. But the open-handedness
of the Yezdi takes other forms besides
the mere giving of money to those who ask for it.
He spends money freely upon his own pleasures:
considering his poverty he lives well: this is true
of all classes: finally, he really enjoys showing
hospitality.</p>

<p>There is in Persian hospitality a great deal
more than the observance of etiquette. Even
the inquisitiveness of the Yezdi is a kind of
attempt to get into real touch with his guest.
In a word, he is essentially human. Most
Europeans who have lived in Persia find it rather
difficult to explain why they like the people.
In the Yezdi there is certainly much to lament,
but there is something to admire, and very much
more to like. A people who are open-handed,
good-natured, affectionate, not always extravagantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
conceited, and above all, intensely human,
are a people one cannot help getting to like when
one lives among them for any time. At the same
time, their inquisitiveness, unpunctuality, intense
dishonesty, frequent ingratitude, and absolute
want of principle in everything, are, to say the
least of it, very trying. As to their exact position
in the scale of civilisation, my personal opinion
of them greatly changed after living through the
Babi massacre of 1903. To find men, and women
too, who had been to a certain extent influenced
by contact with Western ideas and standards, and
who prided themselves on representing the section
of Persian Society most advanced in civilisation
and refinement, openly gloating over horrors that
would pollute these pages if I were to write them,
seemed to us to be an indication of a more radical
difficulty than was evidenced by the horrors themselves.
At the same time, the behaviour of the
Babis under persecution was sufficient to convince
any one that there is plenty of strength in the
Persian character, if only it can be called out.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that it is unfair to the Yezdi’s
character to in any way depreciate the evil effects
of the circumstances among which he lives. His
want of principle, his ferocity, and other similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
points in his character can most of them be traced
to a religious system which was forced upon him
by the sword; for we must remember that he is
four-fifths a Parsi, and only one-fifth an Arab.
The good points in his character are much less
easy to trace to his religion. He is not indisposed
to reform, a fact which is proved by the success of
the Babi movement, the possibilities of which
have been discussed already.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances one can hardly
imagine a country where the call to Christian
missionary work was so peremptory, both because
of the need and because of the peculiar opening
afforded. Missionary work must, of course, be
based rather upon the direct commandment of the
Saviour than upon human judgment. However,
there is no doubt that God sometimes accentuates
His written commands by placing peculiar circumstances
before our eyes, and I cannot conceive
places appealing more strongly to the intelligent
student of the missionary field than these isolated
towns of Persia, one of which I have attempted to
describe.</p>

<p>From what has been previously said it will be
understood that from the missionary point of view
there are, when dealing with the Persian, certain
peculiar difficulties, and also certain things which
tend to make missionary work more easy.
We have to deal with a people whose fundamental
notions of God and of His dealings with
men are absolutely different from our own. I am
not now so much speaking of those tenets on
which the Mussulman loves to dwell, but rather
of those tenets of which he does not think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
necessary to speak, which are not so much the
objects of his faith, but rather indisputable facts
which stand outside the sphere of faith. The
difficulty is not so much that the Persian is repelled
by our holding contrary ideas; he cannot believe
that we hold them; and indeed it is a serious
difficulty that in accepting the Persian language
we often unconsciously admit the very Mussulman
ideas which we intend to attack, and give to the
Persian premises upon which he can build his
whole argument. To give an illustration; a
Persian enquirer will say to the missionary, “Of
course you allow that Moses and David were
prophets?” The missionary will probably admit
this. Now if the Persian has used the most
ordinary term for such prophets, that is, the term
<i>paighambar</i>, he will naturally suppose that the
missionary has admitted the following: first of
all, that God sends from time to time men who are
appointed by Him to reveal a new law of human
action, which, so far as the moral commandments
are concerned, has no necessary connection with previous
revelation; secondly, that Moses and David
gave each of them a sufficient direction to the
peoples of their day to enable them to apprehend
salvation. In all probability your Mussulman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
friend will assume that you have granted even
more; for instance, that Moses and David were
both of them commissioned to invite everyone they
came across to accept their religion; and I should
be sorry to say that you would not have been
supposed to have made other still more impossible
admissions.</p>

<p>I do not think that it would be possible to
avoid this difficulty by extreme scrupulosity in
accepting terms. The result of such hesitation
would probably be to puzzle and perplex the
sincere enquirer who was genuinely anxious to
find out what Christianity really meant. A
more possible way out of the difficulty is to
take the first opportunity of stating the difference
between Mussulman and Christian belief upon
these subjects, and I shall perhaps be pardoned
for suggesting that such matters ought to be
thoroughly thought out beforehand. There are
a good many terms that we use in the present
day, such as “perpetuity of the moral law,” and
“continuity and growth of revelation,” which
require very careful analysis before they can be
presented to minds which have not been
accustomed to the ideas they represent. I have
previously compared the mind of the Yezdi to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a field-glass of very small range and high power,
and have pointed out that the man possessing
such a glass sees very clearly within a limited
area. The Yezdi is utterly different from the
European. The latter looks for a generally
consistent system, and, knowing how difficult
it is to get such a thing, he is content to find
certain points where the agreement has not been
thoroughly worked out. The typical Yezdi expects
a much more clearly worked out conception of
that small number of points which are at one
time presented to his range of vision. But when
he has turned his glasses in another direction
the first set of ideas is blotted out, and the
second group as a whole may be absolutely
contradictory to the first, so long as it is consistent
in itself. The result is that he is
absolutely untouched by criticism which appears
to the European crushing and final. Then the
missionary gets to regard him as an imbecile,
and presents to him an idea which he has not
clearly thought out himself. The Persian turns
the tables on him in a moment, and frequently
the missionary is greatly surprised. The only
way to meet this difficulty is both to prepare
and select your arguments carefully, and, generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
speaking, you can never use with the ordinary
Shiah Mussulman an argument that contains
more than three steps. As to the difficulties
of the language, some have been previously
mentioned, and to these must be added the
entire absence of words conveying certain important
conceptions. Perhaps we are not quite
so badly off as the missionary to the Esquimaux,
who has to explain our Lord’s parables to people
who know of hardly any domestic animals at
all, and who have never seen a tree; nor is
the Persian so intensely dull as the inhabitants
of the Indian district where the mirzas declared
that the meaning of the “field to bury strangers
in” could not possibly be understood unless the
strangers were described as dead; but to find
a people who are sufficiently advanced to have
an elaborate system of psychology, and yet have
no term for conscience is a difficulty of almost
a new kind. Between this sort of deficiency on
the one hand, and on the other the impossibility
of forming a sentence with an accurate meaning,
or of making the meaning understood when it
is formed, the missionary is sometimes inclined
to wish the Persian language at the bottom of
the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>A very similar difficulty is to be found in the
absolute denial, especially by the Babis, of any
limitations to the use of parabolic language. I
can best explain this by instancing a very common
Babi argument, by which it is attempted to
minimise the extraordinary nature of Christ’s
ministry, this being a preparatory step to the
advancement of the claims of Behāu’llah. Christ
on one occasion said, “Let the dead bury their
dead.” In this text it is obvious that the word
“dead” refers in one case rather to spiritual than
to physical death. Consequently, they say, the
miracles of raising the dead to life which are
recounted in the Gospels are not to be taken
as referring to physical death either. The obvious
answer, that parabolic language, when used
without any warning and under circumstances
that make it certain to be interpreted as literal
statement, is simply another name for falsehood,
entirely fails to appeal to the Persian mind, even
though it is pointed out in addition that, in the
stories of the raising of the dead, local colour
and special circumstances are added in such a
way that the details of the stories do not admit
of any intelligible allegoric interpretation.</p>

<p>In meeting this kind of position the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is occasionally increased by the Babi controversialist
being aware that certain European
objectors hold a very similar opinion about our
Lord’s ministry. I think, however, that I am
right in saying that no European critic has ever
attempted to take up what seems to us the
impossible position of accepting the absolute
truth and inspiration of the New Testament,
which the Babi fully admits, while at the same
time trying to explain away the plain statements
of the Gospels.</p>

<p>Another difficulty is that some, and those not
always the least intelligent, of the Yezdi enquirers
mistrust absolutely all reported evidence. This
is after all only the logical result of life in a
Persian town. To say that a certain point, even
the most elementary, such as the fact of our Lord’s
appearance in Palestine nineteen hundred years ago,
is a matter of history, or is universally acknowledged,
means to the Yezdi absolutely nothing.
Sometimes, however, when you are able to explain
that historical criticism is not an impossibility
in Europe, this extreme scepticism partially subsides,
particularly when you are able to show that
the demand for direct evidence is not altogether
impossible to satisfy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, too, there are difficulties in argument
arising from the intense ignorance of the
Yezdi, and more particularly from his extremely
limited ideas of the size of the world. For
instance, when he is repeating the story that the
text of the Bible was changed in the time of
Mohammed, the verses referring to the prophet
being eliminated, it is almost impossible to explain
the enormous difficulty that would have attended
such a proceeding. This must of course be
the case in other places, but I venture to think
that the peculiar nature of the Persian desert
towns makes this state of mind compatible with
a greater degree of intelligence than one would
have believed possible.</p>

<p>When everything has been said, the strong
attachment felt by the Yezdi to Islam remains the
greatest difficulty of all. It has been previously
shown that Islam is much more than a creed,
and much more than a set of commandments.
Behind these things are a number of more or
less connected ideas upon the relations of God
and man, which have not only been accepted
without question for generations, but are considered
by the Mussulman to be axiomatic and
impossible to call in question. Also around Islam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
there has grown up a system of domestic and
social life and of personal habit, which fills up every
moment of the day. Habits of personal cleanliness,
the system of cooking food, the fashion of dress,
and the method of speech are all more or less connected
with Islam. The same thing is true of the
more normal amusements of the Yezdi. There is a
certain amount of singing and playing which is in
direct contravention of Mohammedan law; but the
things which in the life of the people take the
place of the concert-hall and of the theatre are the
<i>ruza-khani</i>, which is the recitation of religious
poems by the Mohammedan mulla, and the
Muharram festival, which is entirely religious,
being a miracle-play depicting the martyrdom of
the Imam Husain. Even the more usual street
shows, which are presented by story-telling
dervishes, are the property of a class possessing a
peculiar religious status. Under these circumstances
who can wonder that to separate himself
from Islam without leaving the country seems to
the enquirer almost impossible? Further, he is
inclined to say that, if it is possible, it is only to be
done by joining himself to the life of the Ferangi
household. It is very difficult to explain to the
Mussulman that Christianity is not a politico-religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
system like Islam, but it is still more
difficult to make him understand that a certain
amount of the Islamic system can in any way
remain lawful to him when he becomes a
Christian.</p>

<p>The difficulty is really an enormous one.
Men who would be ready to face death, if death
was in the air, are not always ready to face boycott
and petty persecution, their neighbours regarding
them as unclean, and their new co-religionists,
though not refusing to associate with them, having
apparently no idea of providing them with a new
home atmosphere. Those, too, who are dependent
on their professions or trades feel that as Christians
the friction with Islam will be so great that,
even if they are not treated as infidels and at
once turned adrift, their seeking of their livelihood
will be a daily martyrdom, often extremely
distressing to their newly-awakened religious
feelings.</p>

<p>All of the obvious solutions of this problem
are almost as difficult as the difficulty itself.
First of all, it might be possible to create an
industrial mission, and to provide new employment
and new circumstances of life for the
converts. Such a move would attract so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
attention in a town like Yezd that it might very
possibly provoke a serious riot; and, even if it
did not do this, it would involve an enormous
financial loss. It would be impossible to get for
such an enterprise the sympathy of the Persian
authorities. The undertaking would be attacked
by a continual succession of intrigues, and even
without these disadvantages it is doubtful whether
Europeans who had to deal with Persians in
matters of trade without being primarily traders
could possibly avoid bankruptcy after a very
short period. Besides this if any such plan was
started, the possibilities of the situation from the
employé’s point of view would so appeal to the
Persian that numbers would come and profess
conversion in order to reap their share in the
benefits. It cannot be too fully pointed out
that in Yezd the man who is not in earnest, and
who is willing to deny sincerity of motive, risks
absolutely nothing, even though he may consent
to public or semi-public ceremonies.</p>

<p>Another solution of the difficulty is to employ
converts in the missionaries’ households, but after
all this only provides for a certain number, and
those only of certain classes. If the less satisfactory
servants and employés were continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
ousted to make room for converts, a further very
serious difficulty would be created, as there would
be a number of people in the town doing their
best to stir up trouble. The position is further
complicated by the number of servants in a
Persian household being very much fewer than
the usual number in an Indian one. At the
same time this solution of the difficulty, when
it is possible, is certainly the best one. Converts
who are employed by Christians are in South
Persia a far from unsatisfactory class, particularly
when they have given up more remunerative
work. When the converts are left too much to
fend for themselves the results are not always
satisfactory, for even when they pull through, a
feeling of not having been properly treated is
sometimes left behind, which is not helpful to
their Christian life. Consequently, I feel that, at
the present stage, converts should, when possible,
be drawn carefully into the organisation of the
mission or the mission households, which would
also have the effect of increasing the missionary
staff. If it is due to our faith in Christ, as it
most surely is, to send out every European man
or woman who comes forward for mission work,
and after prayerful and careful examination or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
training still seems to be set apart for that work
by God, surely in the Persian mission under
present circumstances we might receive as fellow-workers
those who after accepting the Gospel are
thrown upon our hands by the same God. Later
on it may become possible to connect the Persian
mission stations with an industrial organisation
at Bombay, or God may show some other similar
way out of the apparent <i>cul-de-sac</i>. But the
whole difficulty is so great, that perhaps it would
be well to keep it in mind when we are
determining the organisation of missions, for
some methods of work tend to absorb natives of
various classes, while others show no tendency
to do so. In spite of the immense difficulties
in the way of regular industrial missions, some
Persian missionaries hold that they ought to be
started, under the charge of thoroughly competent
men sent out for the purpose. My personal
opinion is that, if it was the main intention that
such work should lead to the formation of an
industrial community of converts earning their
own living and paying their own expenses, there
would probably be a great deal of disappointment
about the results. If, however, such work was
attempted it would have to be done in very close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
conjunction with the strongest of the medical
missions, and a responsibility for backing it
up would have to rest with the doctors in
charge. On the other hand, the establishment of
industrial training classes under competent teachers,
not necessarily European, would not be open to
the same objections. It would really be a development
of school work, and the primary object would
be the assistance of the native population and
the spreading of the Gospel message amongst
them. Like other branches of mission work it
would be worked at as small a loss as possible.
But it would not be a settlement of the great
difficulty, though we might reasonably expect it
to prove a step towards such a settlement, for it
would obviously put us in a position to consider
further steps as occasion offered. After all,
missionary work is the attempting of the impossible
in dependence on the Almighty, and
under such circumstances to attempt to look too
far ahead is absurd.</p>

<p>In the face of these difficulties it is really
wonderful that missionary work in Yezd should
have gone so far forward. There are, of course,
certain elements in Yezdi character and ideas
that have proved a very great assistance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
missionary. Yezdis are always ready to talk
about religion, and they are thoroughly sociable.
Then they are always interested in new ideas,
and are quick to adapt themselves to circumstances.
Further, the ordinary Shiah’s ideas about
the Bible, that is, the Law of Moses and the
Gospel, are somewhat uncertain. He generally
regards it as the Word of God, for he does
not consider that the alterations which he
believes to have been made in the text are
sufficient to rob the Book of its whole value.
Altogether, his ideas are much less stereotyped
than those of the Sunni, and it is often possible
to convince him that the Book is correct
throughout.</p>

<p>Then there is the extreme intelligence of the
Shiah in grasping single points. Some missionaries
work upon this, and also on his essential
weakness, by teaching him Christian ideas, and
not pointing out their contradiction to those
contained in Islam until he has had time to
grasp their value. I am inclined to think that
although this method of teaching may be
possible with people who do not come primarily
as enquirers, it is not so suitable for the Yezdi
who comes to you for discussion or teaching on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the Christian religion. If you want to gain a
particular point with a Persian, for instance if
you wish to dissuade him from some particular
act of cruelty, do not use too long an argument,
but put what you want to say and your reasons
for saying it as shortly as possible. Even if he
does not recognise your principle generally, he
may very possibly accept it for the particular
occasion, if your argument is a plain and short
one; but when an enquirer after Christianity
comes to you, he comes to you as to a follower
of Christ. He does not want your advice about
any particular part of his conduct; he wants
to know why you follow Christ rather than
Mohammed. As a matter of fact you have to
teach him more, but the attempt to teach him
less generally produces a strange state of bewilderment,
in which the man is not very likely to
obey any explicit direction you may have given
him. The man wants, not necessarily controversy,
but teaching of a controversial nature,
opposed to Mohammedanism, that is to the
doctrine of the supremacy of Mohammed’s religion,
and he generally wants such teaching to
be based on some kind of argument, and not
on mere assertion. I think this last statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
is less true of the women. But in our early days
at Yezd, when Dr White and I were both struggling
with the Persian language, and all of the
teaching had to be done by Armenian hospital
assistants, who, although admirable fellows, had
perhaps not wholly grasped exactly what was
wanted, we had strong evidence of what I am
now saying. For the moment I could speak the
language and began to see something of the people,
man after man would come to me, all with the
same question, “We have heard a great deal; a
great deal of Christian teaching, and a great deal
about Jesus Christ; but Sahib, <i>matlab chīst?</i>”
which may be translated, “What is the point of
it all?”</p>

<p>From what has been written it will be obvious
that one of the most essential points in dealing
with Persian visitors is to understand thoroughly
who are enquirers and who are not. Those who
are not primarily enquirers may often be brought
to Christianity almost as easily as those who come
as searchers after truth, for when you get to know
Persians, you can do much with them through
personal influence, and indeed, when all has been
written about ways and methods, the thing most
used of God in Persia is the personality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
particular missionaries. Curiously enough, it is
not always the popular personality by which the
Persian is most affected in big matters, but he
is enormously affected by what we call character.
As to enquirers, it seems to me that no harm
is done by being very careful whom we accept
as such. I must own that I have not always
worked on that principle, and there was a time
when I was under the impression that to refuse
to see a visitor, or to keep him waiting a quarter of
an hour, would be to derogate from the importance
of the message that I had to give, and when I
would plunge without hesitation into the arguments
for the Christian position with any one who
asked me to do so. Possibly at the time it was
the best thing to do, for it was not until I had
pursued this plan that I gained any experience
to enable me to discriminate; but I should
certainly hesitate to advise anybody to follow
my example. Unless a man professes some
serious and practical reason for wanting to know
why he ought to become a Christian it is not
always advisable to tell him. Latterly, when I
was approached on the subject of Christianity,
I always replied by asking the enquirer’s reasons
for searching, and also by asking of what he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
in search, and, if from his answer it was obvious
that he was in search of something which could
be found outside Christianity, I always told him
so. You must remember that such a man
naturally continues talking with you, generally
on religious subjects, and indeed you have then
the opportunity of explaining what Christianity
really is, without the necessity of controversially
proving its truth. He is also just as likely to
return to your house as a man with whom you
have entered into regular argument, and I am
quite convinced that he is not less likely to
appreciate Christianity at its true value than if
you had allowed him to consider that any one
was a proper applicant for admission into the
Christian Church.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the thing which seems to
me to succeed best with Yezdi enquirers is
controversial teaching of a systematic kind.
Pure controversy is sometimes necessary to remove
particular objections to the Gospel message, but
it has to be followed by regular instruction. On
the other hand, instruction that does not bring
out very clearly the contrast between Islam and
Christianity is liable not to be understood. Persian
enquirers seem as a rule to want help in understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the meaning of Scripture. Several
Persian converts have been brought in through
the instrumentality of the Bible without the
help of the missionary; but such cases are not
common.</p>

<p>Then one of the most important points that
the missionary has to bear in mind is that the
Persian expects a concrete example of the
Christian life. He is much more able to understand
what he sees than what he simply reads,
and he is anxious to know how the whole scheme
works out, for he wishes to understand how much
of the practical teaching of Christianity is really
intended for everyday use. He is aware that
in his own religion a good deal can be explained
away by the mulla, and also that rather different
conduct is expected from the clerical and non-clerical
classes respectively. It is true that in
Islam this difference is not so great as one would
expect, but the Mussulman clerics as a class are
certainly more particular than the laity about
prayers, fasts, and attendance at the mosques.
When a Persian sees the Christian colony entirely
at variance with the missionary households as
to religious customs and ideas, he naturally comes
to the conclusion that as a Christian layman he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
will have to conform much more to the practice
of the laity than to the practice of the clerical
class, under which heading he will include all
missionaries. For this reason it seems to me that
it is lamentable for missionaries, clerical or otherwise,
to separate themselves too much from the
social life of the European colony. Work in
such towns as Yezd ought to be primarily church
extension, and when both missionaries and other
Europeans realise this fact, and do their best to
show the native that Christ is a real force in the
concrete European life of the present day, the
hopefulness of mission prospects becomes increased
a thousandfold. But the task before the missionary
is a rather more complex one, for his duty is not
only to present Christ as a living force in his
everyday life, but he ought also to try and avoid
all conduct which he learns by experience will seem
to the native not to tally with the teaching of
Scripture. In other words, he must be ready to
give up lawful things which he is unable to justify
to those whom he is striving to teach. Such a
determination will demand not only strength of
purpose, but also careful and prayerful Bible study;
but unless the determination is made, the work
will inevitably suffer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>One unusually intelligent Behāī, who, I am
glad to say, afterwards became a Christian, once
brought forward an objection to Christianity,
which I think is worth closely noting. He said,
“You point to the comparative prosperity of
Europe as an evidence of the truth of Christianity.
I, who have been in India, do not doubt that
Europeans have accomplished something. But it
seems to me that what has been done has been
done by the State organisation, which rests upon
the law of retaliation, and is therefore in direct
opposition to the law of Christ. Consequently
these successes prove not the truth of Christianity,
but rather the power of work done on exactly
opposite principles.” My answer, which was
accepted, was to point out that although Christ
in the Sermon on the Mount showed that the
principle of retaliation was not to govern the
actions of individual Christians, Christ’s religion
both as expounded by Himself before Pilate,
and as presented by His apostles in the Epistles,
recognises the power of the force-using governor
as that of God’s minister. I also pointed out
that the best European State organisations had
only been made possible by the Church. However,
the objection was certainly one which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
serious enquirer might be pardoned for advancing,
and it is interesting as showing the trend of the
Persian’s mind when he comes into contact with
European customs and Christian ideas.</p>

<p>There remain several difficulties, connected
rather with the acceptance of converts than with
the making of them. The Persian is exceedingly
impulsive, and a great many enquirers who are
really in earnest ask to be baptized without
realising all that it will mean. This, I suppose,
is a difficulty one finds everywhere. A difficulty
more peculiar to Persia has already been mentioned
in a previous chapter, namely, the feeling that
two motives are better than one, and that the
desire for earthly as well as spiritual gain
only makes a man a more earnest applicant. In
Yezd it is impossible to treat people who have
this feeling as radically unsound, but of course
they have to be taught that it is impossible to
become a Christian from the two points of view,
and that if they intend to make Christianity pay
from the earthly point of view, they will lose
the spiritual benefit. The question may perhaps
be asked, how is it that in a Mohammedan
country there can be supposed to be any temporal
advantage in becoming a Christian? The answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to this is that the Yezdi Persian is accustomed
not so much to religious as to politico-religious
systems: so he regards the whole European
colony with their native servants, Parsi and
Mussulman, as all belonging to Christianity and
under the protection of the Christian authorities,
and this idea is very largely kept up by the
servants themselves. Servants in a Christian
household will almost invariably join in any form
of Christian worship, and it would be impossible
to explain to them that they did not to some
extent participate in the spiritual advantages of
Christianity. They recognise, however, a distinct
difference between taking service and accepting
baptism. Probably in their heart of hearts they
believe that taking service is temporary, and
accepting baptism permanent. Amongst people
who are accustomed to a view of the household
largely corresponding to the patriarchal view,
such notions cannot be altogether eradicated.
So enquirers, when they first ask for baptism,
do not necessarily see the enormous danger, but
only realise that they will be brought into close
touch with a community that seems to them to
include other natives who wear the same dress as
themselves. Of course when the enquirers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
junior members of strict Mussulman households, or
in other equally unfavourable circumstances, they
realise that their peril will be extreme; but heads
of households sometimes expect much less danger.
Then again, the Mussulman is accustomed to
secret religions, for <i>taqiya</i>, the denial of faith in
times of danger, has always been considered lawful
by Shiahs, and it is used by the Babis. Although
the enquirer learns at a very early date that
such conduct is regarded by the Christian as
sin, it takes him some time to realise the exact
degree to which his Christianity is likely to be
public. Lastly, although he may be told that
converts are not under consular protection, in
a country where law means so little and custom
so much he is not likely to understand how
real are the boundaries of treaty rights. This
will perhaps give some idea of the amount of
misapprehension, both as to the meaning of
Christianity and also as to the danger of accepting
it, which may possibly exist after a considerable
amount of talk and enquiry; nor would
the dangers of embracing Christianity be made
altogether obvious by a single riot or martyrdom;
for the whole operation of Persian law, or want
of law, is irregular and spasmodic, and in a town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
like Yezd things which are foolhardy in January
are often attended with no more than ordinary
risk in June.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the question of the
admission of professing converts to baptism must
necessarily be extremely difficult. In towns where
the mission work is in a pioneering stage it has
to be primarily settled by the European missionary;
and not until the difficulty has been by him
sufficiently solved to admit of the foundation of
a church, can much of this burden be placed upon
other shoulders. Sometimes he may have the good
fortune to have among his earlier converts a wholly
trustworthy man, who, from his greater experience
of native character and knowledge of what is going
on in the town, can advise and counsel him, but
even then the main responsibility must rest with
the European. The difficulty is greatly enhanced
by the fact that the missionary in Persia does
not really live amongst the people, and that the
clerical missionary usually sees enquirers only in
his own house. Under these circumstances it is
perhaps well not to apply too many tests, for it
is not easy to get a test which is really sound.
One test which is sometimes advocated is the
practice of keeping the catechumen waiting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a long period; but the result of this is frequently
to deter those who are weakly in earnest, whereas
a Persian who has a worldly end to serve is
capable of extraordinary patience. It is sometimes
urged that an unsound convert brings the whole
band of native Christians and enquirers into
extreme danger; but I am inclined to think that,
in the circumstances of our pioneer missions as
they at present exist, a totally unsound catechumen
may do almost as much harm as even an unsound
convert. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that
the only way to deal with the situation is to
baptize all persons who after full instruction, not
too hurriedly given, profess conversion and demand
baptism, and even after baptism to observe a
certain degree of caution towards the newly
baptized. If it is absolutely proved that such
converts are behaving in a manner that is not
only weak but actively hostile towards Christ’s
cause, they must be excommunicated; but the
most necessary point of all is that as much
attention should be paid to the instruction of
converts as to the instruction of catechumens. It
is of course impossible to expect that all points
of character should be absolutely changed after
baptism, and nobody ought to be cut loose from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the Church in a place like Yezd, unless he is
actively hostile; and, even when actual hostility
has been proved, an opportunity ought to be
given for the man’s return.</p>

<p>As to the advisability of giving converts
material help, a great deal may be said against
it in theory, but in practice it is at times
absolutely necessary. After all, it is impossible
to avoid mistakes, and the attempt to avoid all
mistakes in detail is only too likely to lead to the
more general one of entirely failing to present
Christ in any form whatsoever.</p>

<p>The conclusions which have been stated in this
chapter are not intended to be taken as the
fully thought out summing up of an extremely
complex and difficult problem. They are the
result of rather less than six years’ experience
of the mission-field. But just as there is a value
in first impressions of country, so there is a value
in first impressions of difficulties in work. At
five and a half years first impressions of country
have passed away, and consequently the contents
of the earlier chapters of this book, which deal
with country and surroundings, can hardly be so
characterised; but at this period the difficulties of
mission work are only just beginning to spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
themselves out before one’s eyes. So when we
pass from country to character, from character
to opportunity, and from opportunity to
suggestion, we pass from subjects with
which it is comparatively easy to become
familiar to subjects which need life-long and
careful study. I have tried in writing this
chapter to eliminate from the style that consciousness
of uncertainty which is frequently
so irritating to the reader; but in doing this
I should explain that I am fully conscious
of the superficial nature of much that I have
written. At the same time, the view that I
have gained of mission work in Yezd is a full
one compared with that which is possible for
people at a distance, and for that reason it may
be considered worth stating.</p>

<p>In Persia the missionary has no right to teach
and preach in public places. He cannot take
up his stand in the bazaars and proclaim the
Gospel. He can talk to the people who come
to his house, and to a certain extent he can talk
with crowds in open caravanserais or in the
villages, but anything approximating to public
teaching is only done on sufferance, and without
any established licence. So the ordinary evangelistic
missionary’s first task is to get on terms
of social intercourse with a sufficiently large
number of natives to afford him a field for work.
Afterwards he may arrange for services, either
in his own house or in the house of some other
European, and so his visitors will become congregations
and his talks sermons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, although it is obvious that such work
can only be carried on when it is acceptable to
the natives, the work may be accepted for very
various reasons. If the missionary knows enough
of the Persian language, of native ideas, and
above all of the message he has come to deliver,
he will, in a town like Yezd, without the help of
school or medical work, attract a large number
of people to his house. In Persia there is just
now a great seeking after truth, which, though
due in part to traceable causes, seems in its
entirety to be simply one of those mysterious
movements which God evokes at certain seasons
in all lands for the furtherance of His Kingdom.
One class attracted by such a man as I have
described would therefore be real enquirers, and
with them would be mixed a second class of
people who have been called religious sightseers.
These men though not apparently so good a field
for work as the first class, would still, if properly
handled and directed, prove a perfectly possible
sphere for serious missionary operations. So also
would the third class of callers, who would be
men not primarily interested in religious questions
at all, but who would nevertheless follow the
fashion of calling on the newly-arrived foreigner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and would be generally willing to follow any line
of conversation that was agreeable to their host.
Of course a man who did not intend to engage
in school or medical work would naturally be
careful to take full advantage of such contacts
as these, and of others that he would naturally
make from time to time; he would order his life
in such a way as to get day by day into close
touch with the people of the town; and he would
equip himself with a material outfit that would
enable him to exchange courtesies with natives
of various classes. I am not speaking of a man
who elected to spend most of his time itinerating
in the villages: of such work as this I have little
experience: but I am convinced that a stationary
missionary, fairly well equipped at all points,
does not in a town like Yezd absolutely need the
help of more elaborate aids to enable him to
get into touch with his work. To suppose this
is to ignore the extraordinary preparation which
God has made in Persia for the preaching of the
Gospel.</p>

<p>Before passing on to the very real demand
for missionaries of a somewhat different kind, it
will be well to mention some points connected
with the life of the European missionary in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
country. There are probably very few men or
women at present working in Persia, who have
not at the outset of their work felt doubtful
whether the details of their household life could
not be simplified, so as to bring them into closer
touch with the poorer part of the population. It
is hardly possible to write a serious book on
missionary conditions without expressing an opinion
on this question. There is, I think, no doubt
that it is a great mistake for a missionary in
Persia to be known as one who is leading the life
of a wealthy man. It is considered by many of
the enquirers to be absolutely inconsistent with
Christianity, and I am not sure that this judgment
is incorrect. Temporary advantages might sometimes
be gained by such a reputation, but in the
end the work would suffer.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, however, it is the habit of
missionaries in the Persian stations to live as
economically as is compatible with European
style, so far as their strictly personal expenses
are concerned. Many things which appear at
first sight to be luxurious prove on closer acquaintance
to be mere substitutes for the ordinary
necessaries of the simplest English life. Other
things prove to be absolutely essential to health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in a hot climate, while yet another class are not
exactly necessary, but they are comforts of the
cheapest kind. People who are economising
seriously in Eastern lands have to put up with so
much that is really difficult that they make a great
mistake if they unnecessarily deny themselves
small things which can be had for the asking,
simply because they have regarded such things as
luxuries in England. But although the existence
of careful economies on European lines may be
sufficient to prevent an intelligent enquirer from
thinking that the missionary is untrue to his creed,
such economies can never bring the missionary into
touch with the poor of the East in the same way
that living in a model lodging-house might under
some circumstances bring a home clergyman into
close touch with the English poor. The real analogy
would be for the missionary to live as an Eastern
dervish, or as a native of the artisan class, and
although this might be sometimes helpful and
advisable, the principle of its general advisability
could not be accepted. To begin with, it
would be only possible for a bachelor, and, in
a country where no man can possibly give individual
instruction to women, the bachelor is at
a great disadvantage. Secondly, it must not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
forgotten that, although the missionary living the
life of an European has been accepted in Persia,
the missionary wearing Persian dress and living
like a native has not yet been accepted, and
would probably find himself not only at variance
with the consular authorities but also regarded
with a great deal of suspicion by the natives themselves.
In a matter of this kind it is impossible to
ignore apostolic precedent, and one thing that
cannot but strike the student of the missionary
methods of the period covered by the Acts of the
Apostles is that the apostles generally, and notably
St Paul, seem never to have adopted a method of
missionary work which would have seemed to the
inhabitants of the district to be <i>outré</i>, when some
more natural method of work was equally possible.
Nothing would strike the Persian as more <i>outré</i>
than for the ordinary European to drop the form
of life which is expected of the Ferangi, and to
adopt the manners and customs of the native of
Persia, particularly as he would probably have to
periodically re-assume European clothes. If he
was going to work among the Mussulmans as a
Christian missionary, I suppose he would have to
choose between life as an Armenian and life as a
Mussulman. Life as an Armenian would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
this advantage over the other, that he would
not be supposed to be hiding his religion. But
the life of the Armenian in a town like Yezd
is the life of a stranger in a foreign town, and
would not bring the missionary into very much
closer touch with the Mussulmans than life as a
European. By assuming the dress and manners of
an Armenian of any class whatsoever, one would
simply forfeit the respect that is usually paid by
the Persian to the Ferangi, without gaining anything
that could not have been gained by other
and more ordinary methods. On the other hand,
life as a Mussulman would be attended with serious
difficulties. In a town where there was a Ferangi
colony wearing European dress, such a man would
very possibly be regarded as a soldier is regarded
who attempts to mix with the enemy without his
uniform. I can conceive circumstances which
might make an experiment of this kind worth
trying, but it would be madness for any one to
attempt it for missionary purposes, who had not
extraordinary experience of the country and a full
mastery over the language.</p>

<p>I think then we must take it for granted that
the kind of life which missionaries are living in
Persia at the present time will have to be accepted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
with such modifications as future events and
further experience may suggest, as the normal
method for Europeans who wish to carry on
missionary work in the country. There are one or
two tasks which lie before the pioneer missionary
which seem to be made more easy by the possession
of an ordinary European household. First of
all, he has to be prepared to work amongst the
European colony. Secondly, it is well for him to
possess sufficient influence and standing in the
town to be able to help the converts or enquirers
in time of trouble. Thirdly, he wants to be in
touch with all classes of natives, and this would
probably only be possible for a man who stood
in the highest rank as a native, or for one who
stood outside native rank altogether.</p>

<p>Every missionary has to do a good deal of
visiting. All visits have not got to be returned,
but a certain number must be. It is well not to
return all visits, for otherwise it is difficult to get
secret enquirers to come to your house, or people
who are too poor to receive you in their own
houses. The usual Persian habit is never to pay
a visit without first of all asking leave, but though
this rule has to be observed towards others, it is
best to make it clear that your own house is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
office, and only to insist on notice for visits of
civility when they are made by people who are
likely to prove awkward. Paying visits to Persian
houses has a certain value to the missionary, as it
introduces him to Persian life and manners, and
puts him on easier terms with the natives, but
it seldom affords the evangelistic missionary who
is working amongst men his best opportunity for
direct missionary work. There is too much
publicity, and too many interruptions. The best
missionary work is usually done on one’s own
premises; and in Yezd I have known enquirers
and visitors begin coming at six o’clock in the
morning, and go on almost without intermission
till ten o’clock at night; but at that time I was
connected with scholastic work, which, although
requiring only superintendence, advertised my
presence in the town to a considerable degree.
One of the things that is therefore most necessary
in a place like Yezd for the evangelistic missionary
is an absolutely well-ordered household. Everything
ought to go by clockwork. Almost every
visitor has to be treated as an ordinary social
guest, and unless the arrangements are nearly
perfect, either his attention or the missionary’s
will be called away from the conversation. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
missionary in such a position ought to pay close
attention to the number and description of his tea-cups
and pipes. One class of visitors ought to be
properly served with silver-mounted hookahs and
three tiny cups of very hot tea, brought in at
intervals of ten minutes, and this without any
previous notice to the servant. Another class
of visitor ought to have a European cup of tea
holding about three times as much as the Persian
cup, and a box of cigarettes, so that he and his
host may be able to talk without further interruption
till the end of the interview. A third class
of visitor, who has given notice, ought to be
prepared for beforehand, and served with iced
sherbet. Then again, a decision has to be made
according to the status of the guest as to whether
the missionary shall be served with tea at the
same time or not. All this requires the most
careful training of servants, and any inattention to
detail may produce an atmosphere which makes
teaching exceedingly difficult. Further, the
servants have to know who should be shown
into a private room, and who can be allowed to
mix with other guests. These are just a few of
the minor points which are nevertheless of real
importance. To come to points which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
obviously more serious. Servants have to be
procured who can act with firmness when people
attempt to take liberties, and who are at the same
time absolutely civil. Servants in a Christian
household have to be good-tempered; and in order
to effect this they have to be kept well occupied
without being overworked, in a house where the
chief work is meeting emergencies. They have
to be taught some consistent and systematic line
that is to be observed in dealing with the countless
beggars who every day come to your house.
They have to be rendered as truthful as possible in
every matter connected with the missionary’s
business. They have to be paid a rate of wages
which will make honesty and contentment possible,
and which will neither spoil the market, nor be
incompatible with reasonable economy. It is
needless to say very much more about these
matters; sufficient has already been said to make
it plain that the problem of household arrangement
is an exceedingly difficult one, particularly as the
servants sleep in their own houses at a distance,
all but one, who stays for the night; and they
generally expect to go home for their mid-day
meal. My own impression is that as the evangelistic
missionary’s house is almost his parish, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
may be excused if he thinks right to expend a
very great deal of time over its arrangements, and
to consider this just as much missionary work as
the teaching of enquirers. If the missionary
intends to aim at anything that is likely to be
satisfactory in this matter, he certainly needs an
enormous degree of faith, and will do well to make
his efforts in this direction the subject of very
earnest prayer.</p>

</div>

<p>Another difficulty in seeing enquirers in the
house is the arrangement of times. Missionaries
are sometimes blamed for not sufficiently consorting
with Europeans in the ordinary amusements
of the colony, but there is one great
difficulty about this. The times when you
naturally take exercise in the East are the
times when the native artisan or shopkeeper is
off work. Supposing that the evangelistic
missionary is seldom at home at such times as
these, the more industrious Persians get to
regard him as inaccessible, and his enquirers
begin to consist of people who for some reason
or other have very little to do. It is hardly
necessary to enter into the difficulties that may
follow.</p>

<p>We have been hitherto speaking only of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
directly evangelistic methods of missionary work;
but almost all missionaries have something to do
with philanthropic work also. These philanthropic
efforts are not solely undertaken as means to an
end. In most cases they are treated as an end
in themselves by the missionary, and generally
speaking they are things which could not well
be left undone. Medical missionaries will tell
you that their standing orders are to heal the
sick and preach the Gospel; but I think we
may say very much more generally that the
presentation of the Gospel without adequate and
proportionate care for the minds and bodies of
those surrounding us, would be impossible. For
the Gospel is the message of our Saviour, and
any message that was so delivered would entirely
fail to represent that Saviour’s attitude. I doubt
whether any one would call in question this aspect
of the case, but when we come to discuss how
much philanthropic work is really necessary, we
are face to face with a difficult problem. In
matters like this the decision must depend not
only upon the needs of the people with whom
the missionaries are brought in contact, but also
upon the nature of the church or congregation
of Christians that supports them, and whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
material as well as spiritual force they are
appointed to convey to the mission field. There
is a great difference between the position of a
band of men sent out by an infinitesimal body
of earnest Christians who have the greatest
difficulty in subscribing the means of their
support, and that of a band sent out by an
exceedingly wealthy Christian church.</p>

<p>Present-day missionaries sent out by the
Church Missionary Society have passed outside
the conditions of the first class, but they cannot
be said to fully belong to the second. They are
supported by a large number of people, but those
who give most are generally those whose purses
are least elastic. In the countries to which they
go they are treated with the greatest courtesy
by British officials, and accepted as representatives
of the religion of England by their fellow-countrymen.
Naturally the native expects more from
them than they are really able to give, and this
increases the difficulty when they have to decide
what they are bound to do as ministers of Christ
and as representatives of those who send them,
for the people committed to their charge.
Naturally, and I think rightly, they do not
wholly shut their eyes to the attitude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
expectations of the natives. But, unfortunately,
the Persians think that there ought to be no
difficulty about anything. The average native
cannot get out of his head the idea that we are
sent by the Government, or, if not by the
Government, by the whole nation under its
religious authorities. Those who know anything
of English thought and feeling realise that
foreign missions are now well established in the
popular regard in England, and many Yezdis
have a confused notion that in our country
education, medical attendance, and support in
old age are free to everybody, irrespective of
class, and that as Christians we are all anxious
to extend this system as far as we can to other
nations. Of course views like this are variable,
but it may be seen after a moment’s consideration
that in a country where the need for schools,
for hospitals, and sometimes for relief is very
real, and where the native is capable of believing
such absurdities about the European as have
been stated, if the missionary does not to a large
extent take up the white man’s burden, he is
likely to lose any influence which God may
have given him. Consequently I think we may
say that the philanthropic work of missionaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in Persia must not only be regarded as a means
to evangelisation, although this is an aspect
which must largely determine its importance.
Primarily it is a spiritual necessity created by
three things, the comparative wealth of the
Christians who send out the missionaries, the
comparative poverty of the natives who are ready
to be relieved, and the obvious commandment
of Almighty God.</p>

<p>Philanthropic work in Yezd is of three kinds;
medical work, school work, and the work of poor
relief. The last is of course not recognised or
supported by the Church Missionary Society. It
is not within the scope of this book to deal with
either of these three provinces of work in detail.
All that I wish at present to explain is the way
in which they seem to strike the Persian mind,
and contribute to the general campaign of the
mission.</p>

<p>Relief work is of all the three most absolutely
necessitated by the essential difference between
the circumstances of the missionary and his
supporters on the one hand, and those of a
certain section of the natives on the other. But
from an evangelistic standpoint it is the least
directly productive in effect; so we have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in Yezd used for this purpose any funds not
specially subscribed for it, and such money has
been collected almost entirely from the resident
Europeans. There is a very great deal of terrible
poverty in Persia which is not touched by the
native charities. In Yezd, particularly towards
the end of our stay in the town, things were
in a very bad way. Yezd is really an industrial
town, and not less than half of the grain supply
comes from outside, chiefly from the Shiraz
district. Most of the people are silk weavers.
The silkworms used to be reared in the Yezd
district, but the extreme droughts rendered this
source of supply very insecure, and after the
great famine that occurred some years ago there
were not sufficient trees left for the business
to be continued in this way. Cocoons were then
brought from Rasht, and this system proved
more satisfactory till lately, when the Rasht
cocoons were diverted to France and Italy.
The natural result was a great deal of poverty
in Yezd, which was most felt among the
poor Jews, who since the famine year have
had no looms but have devoted themselves to
winding and spinning the silk. Then again, after
the Babi massacre of 1903, something had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
done for the large number of widows and
orphans. In this work the Europeans were by
no means alone, for the sufferers were helped
both by the Babi merchants and also by a large
number of the Parsis. The Parsis are generally
very good in looking after their own poor, but
the Mussulmans give money so indiscriminately
that their charities cause more poverty than they
relieve. Although the work of poor relief is not
as a rule the direct means of bringing in converts,
it helps the evangelistic work enormously
by saving valuable time. Before it could be
organised the number of begging enquirers who
had the very smallest interest, if any, in the
Gospel message, was so large as to seriously
impede more important work. It is much easier
and better to keep the two things more separate,
and to be able to say to a man, “If you want to
read with me, well and good, but if you want
material help, then you must do so and so.” This
does not necessarily mean that the man who is
relieved gets no chance of hearing the Gospel.
The Jews, who came in a body, used always to
have a chapter of the Gospel read to them by
my mirza, and any man who showed a disposition
to come as a real enquirer after his case had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
looked into and relieved was thoroughly welcomed.
But the practice of trying to earn a <i>kran</i> by
wasting hours of the missionary’s time was
effectually discouraged.</p>

<p>I think also that the practice of separating
poor relief as much as possible from the work
with enquirers helps to explain to the native
our view of the Christian Church. That some
explanation is necessary is undoubted. During
a severe famine in Kirman, over two hundred
respectable Mussulmans, chiefly shopkeepers,
came into the courtyard of the Consulate, and
wanted to take protection under the British
flag. Major Phillott was then Consul, and they
explained to him that the price of bread was so
prohibitive that they could not live any longer
under the regulations of the Persian officials.
Their leader was a Seyid. Major Phillott tried to
explain that, although he sympathised with them
greatly, he could do nothing for them unless it
was to give them pecuniary help. He offered
them a hundred <i>krans</i>, but they explained that
they were not beggars. They further said that
they were quite ready to become Christians if
they could only get cheap bread. The end of
the whole business was that the Consul paid an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
unofficial visit to the Governor, and got him to
promise that bread should be lowered to a more
or less normal price by gradual reductions spread
over a period of ten days. It is easy to understand
that people who could go to a Consul in a famine
and ask to be accepted as Christians in order
to be able to buy bread at a fair price, thinking
I suppose that Consular pressure would then be
brought to bear upon the Governor on their
behalf, might easily get an absolutely wrong
notion of what was going on, if circumstances
forced the missionary whose general business
was seeing enquirers to use funds for poor
relief without carefully separating these two
branches of work. Even the practice of giving
occasional relief to very poor enquirers from one’s
own purse is liable to great misinterpretation and
abuse. Men will frequently come to you and
ask for support, so as to enable them to leave
their ordinary trades and listen to your teaching.
Myself, I think that there are occasions when
poor people have come from a distance and are
certainly interested, where something of this
kind has to be done, the man if possible being
made to work for his money; but it is easy to
see how extremely dangerous it would be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
encourage expectations, and how easily natives
might get the idea that enquiry, and still more
Christianity, entitled them to payment. Consequently,
even if it could not be demonstrated
that an actual saving of time was effected by
making of poor relief a distinct organisation,
there would be still a very great deal to be
said for the practice.</p>

<p>To administer poor relief in a town like Yezd
on anything approaching to a sound system
necessitates a great deal of reliance upon native
information, and also a certain amount of high-handed
dealing. Any food or clothing given
must be of a class only acceptable to the very
poorest, for otherwise the candidates for relief
would be too numerous to deal with in even
the roughest fashion. These considerations will
explain two things; first of all it will be
readily understood that it is much easier to
give systematic relief to members of a native
community which is more or less down-trodden,
such as the Jews or Babis; for although a
certain number of mistakes will be made in
dealing with these peoples, they will be much
less resented, and will militate much less against
the success of the whole effort. Secondly, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
will be obvious that such relief will not call
forth very much gratitude from the recipients.
The very fact of investigation gives the idea
to the Persian mind that charity is given
grudgingly. Also it is impossible to handle a
hundred screaming women in a small compound
without a certain amount of what appears to
be stern dealing, and after all in most instances
the relief given is not as much as we ourselves
would like it to be. Added to this, most of
the people receiving relief are under the impression
that we are simply dispensing a small part
of the large supplies sent to us for the purpose
from abroad; and the Jews, of whom nearly a
hundred families were receiving relief in Yezd
last winter, believed that all that was given to
them came from their co-religionists in Europe.
The Babis of course looked upon the matter
rather differently, but people who hold the
theory of <i>savabs</i> in the way in which Persians
do, have always a feeling that anything given
to them means one for them and two for the
giver. At the same time Persians who are
interested in Christianity, and who are not
themselves candidates for poor relief, see a great
deal more in the system than do those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
more intimately concerned with it. They often
understand that the willingness to take trouble
in localising need, and the absolute recklessness
with which we incur as many curses as blessings
in the performance of our work, points to an
utterly different ideal from that which is accepted
in Islam; and whether they are prepared to
approve it or not, anything which shows the
native part of the fundamental distinction between
Islam and Christianity must in the end be of
enormous assistance in missionary work.</p>

<p>School work in Yezd is very greatly appreciated
by a somewhat limited class, but it means continual
friction. The whole Mussulman clerical
class as a body are keenly opposed to it. More
curiously it aroused the greatest opposition from
a small but not unimportant section of the
Parsis. The Parsis are a puzzling people. For
though they are strong, intelligent, thrifty,
industrious, grateful, and comparatively honest,
they seem to have a tendency to produce in their
community a sufficient number of exceptionally
disagreeable specimens of humanity to greatly
check their natural progress. I myself believe
that this is due to the prevalence of agnosticism
amongst them, but, however that may be, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
result is that the Yezd community is always
pestered by internal intrigues. I do not think
that the opposition to my school was religious,
for the <i>dastūrs</i>, that is the Zoroastrian priests,
were always very friendly. I have always put
it down rather to internal intrigue.</p>

<p>My school work was originally undertaken at
the explicit request of the natives, and the boys
came chiefly, but not wholly, from the upper
classes. It would be difficult, and very questionably
advisable, to start school work in a town
like Yezd except under pressure from the natives.
Even when the work has been forced on one,
it is very difficult to maintain it. Not only is
there still opposition from such quarters as I
have mentioned, but it is only with the greatest
difficulty that competent native assistance can be
secured. If native assistance cannot be secured,
the missionary who has work with enquirers
will have difficulty in finding time even for
short classes. Short classes may be the best
thing under certain circumstances, but in a
town like Yezd they do not meet the whole
need. Boys are brought to you in Persia in
most cases primarily to be taught English, but
this demand for English is not the only requirement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
nor is it the only need that is felt by the
Persians. Persians will frequently tell you that
they bring their boys to you for education in
the largest sense; but we made it a practice in
Yezd only to accept boys who wished to learn
English, and whose parents could show that the
knowledge of English was likely to be of some
use to them. Very frequently poor lads would
come, under the impression that the town was
going to be occupied by Europeans, and that all
who had learnt English would get remunerative
employment in Yezd. The only thing to do
under such circumstances was to explain the true
state of affairs, and then to insist on payment
being made in advance for all books, and also
upon the payment of a six months’ fee. The
first argument was generally rather ineffectual,
but supported by the second it always had the
desired result. If it could be shown that a poor
boy was likely to reap advantage from a knowledge
of English, fees were always remitted, and
in some cases books were provided.</p>

<p>The ordinary fees were very small, but had
to be paid in advance for the half year. The
education given comprised Persian subjects,
arithmetic, English, and elementary geography.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
The Bible was read in Persian, night and morning,
and the boys were expected to be present during
the Bible reading and prayers. Latterly the whole
routine work was put into the hands of natives,
but I paid as much attention not only to
superintendence but also to conversational classes
as my other engagements would allow. Naturally
there was a great difference in the efficiency of
the school at different times. At first it was with
the greatest difficulty that the work could be
carried on at all, and what I was able to do was
of the most trivial character. In the end, owing
to the excellent work done by my Armenian
assistants, and by Mihraban, my Parsi mirza, the
results were really excellent. On the whole, I
think I may say that the confidence reposed in
the school system by the natives, was greater
than I could have expected, and in many things
both boys and parents proved excessively
forbearing.</p>

fire-place coming forward into the room is not of a usual shape:
fire-places are generally let into the wall. All the boys in this
picture are Mussulmans.</p>
</div>

<p>In the matter of gratitude they showed
discrimination, but the gratitude that was shown
me by the pupils who stuck to the school for
any time, and by their parents, was extraordinary.
The lads themselves, both Parsi and Mussulman,
were on the whole intelligent and teachable. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
had, however, very much greater success in dealing
with them when I had not myself to undertake
the routine work of the schoolmaster. Possibly
this was due partially to my not being suited for
such work, but I am inclined to think that in
most cases elementary school work is not quite
the proper field for the European missionary in
Persia. There is perhaps no harm in the
evangelistic missionary who has not yet perfected
himself in the language devoting more of his
time to it; but, considering the enormous value
of the work from a spiritual point of view, there
should be no difficulty in getting funds to employ
extra native assistants where the European
missionary feels himself in a position to organise
and superintend a school for native boys. These
remarks do not apply to schools for girls, for
which properly qualified native teachers can only
be found with the greatest difficulty. My feeling
is that not only can the fully qualified European
missionary be more usefully employed if his time
is not too largely given up to school work, but
also much of the actual work of the school is
better done by natives under European management,
and the influence of the missionary with
the boys may be rather increased than checked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
by his not having to teach them their ordinary
lessons. It is, however, very difficult to separate
what may be taken as a general principle in
Persia from what was true of our particular
circumstances in Yezd. I have before mentioned
that I do not consider myself very fitted for
ordinary school work.</p>

<p>In the boys’ school in Yezd we had at first
a custom of never admitting a child until his
father had been seen, and had thoroughly understood
to what extent he would receive religious
teaching. I used to pledge myself to teach
nothing to the boy of Christian tradition apart
from what could be found in the <i>Kalāmu’llah</i>,
that is, the Word of God accepted by the Mohammedans,
an expression which was thoroughly
understood to include the whole of the Christian
Bible. This may seem at first sight to have been
merely a quibble, but it must not be forgotten
in dealing with the Mussulman, that he is afraid
of something like Romanism which will stand
out in political as well as religious rivalry to
Islam, and that he knows very little of the
special tenets of Protestants. My assurance
would at least have satisfied him that no attempt
would be made to draw the boy into a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
politico-religious system. The fathers were also
told that the boys would be expected to attend
prayers. Latterly, as the school and its methods
got better known, the necessity for these precautions
disappeared. However, when boys at
the school came to me, as they frequently did,
and told me that they wished to know more
about Christianity, I invariably insisted that their
fathers or guardians should be informed before
they received special instruction. Of course they
were always free to come to the Sunday School,
which was held for them by my Armenian
assistant, and which was attended by a few boys
from other schools as well, and occasionally by
one or two men. Many of the boys also were
extremely regular in their attendance at the
services, which we held at first in our houses,
and afterwards in a chapel which was built in
the hospital.</p>

<p>Our school work in Yezd was in every way a
thoroughly effective evangelistic agency. It
brought me into touch with scores of adults who
without it would never have entered my house.
By increasing the general business with which
I was surrounded, it also greatly facilitated my
contact with those who came to me as regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
enquirers. All this was additional to the direct
effects of the school work, which I have reason to
believe were exceedingly satisfactory. Altogether
school work proved in Yezd to be one of the
most effective forms of missionary effort.</p>

<p>At the same time one or two things have to
be borne in mind about it. First of all, it is
extremely difficult for the evangelistic missionary
to organise school work for the teaching of
Persian subjects only that will successfully
compete with the native schools. Further, the
need for such work is not greatly felt by the
natives. But the teaching of English is one of
those things which missionaries are distinctly asked
to undertake, and which they are able to undertake
with great advantage. In a short time I have
no doubt that industrial education will be an even
more pressing need. The argument for schools
as against classes is that their effect upon the
moral character of the boys is much greater, and
that the qualified missionary has by himself time
for neither, unless indeed the classes are to be very
short ones, and the staff that would be needed
to properly undertake classes might just as well
manage a school.</p>

<p>With regard to fees, it seems to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
when assistants are employed fees should be
charged; but to get fees that would really cover
the expenses would be impossible, and I personally
think that the lower the fee the more easy it is
to enforce its payment, and to keep the arrangements
of the school entirely in one’s own hands.
This, however, is a matter over which there is
plenty of room for difference of opinion. Of one
thing I am certain, and that is that in the up-country
towns educational work must begin
amongst classes who can support the missionary
against Persian intrigues and the direct opposition
of the Mulla class. In starting a school in a
Mussulman country the object of the missionary
must always be to get the establishment regarded
as a settled fact, consequently certain things which
would otherwise be unimportant become matters
of extreme moment. For instance, if anything
should happen to the teaching staff, the school
must be kept running, even if the pupils cannot
under the circumstances make great progress.
At one time I had to keep the school going when
I was myself laid up in a sick room, and had no
assistant capable of teaching much more than the
primers. The day’s work for the first class was
written out by my wife, and sent into the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
by a servant. However, the school survived, and
some while later, when it was again properly
staffed, we saw the effects of our persistence, for
while the town was absolutely under mob law,
the school was never without a certain number of
boys attending at the regular hours. Again, when
the position of the school is temporarily assured,
nothing can be better than some sort of public
Speech Day, which both advertises its existence,
and makes people understand that you regard its
permanence as a matter of course. The fact is
that in Persia all opposition and persecution is
spasmodic, and if you can manage to go your
own way for a sufficient time and then take your
position for granted, you will be allowed to do
things which vastly exceed your recognised rights
and liberties.</p>

<p>Medical mission work in Persia has been
described by those who have been actively engaged
in it. Under these circumstances I intend to
speak very much less about it than I have done
about other methods of work, though it is at least
as important as any. It would be possible to
divide the provinces of medical work in several
ways, but it seems to me to be best treated under
three heads: hospital work, dispensary work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and medical visiting. The branch of medical work
which is most obviously necessary, and also perhaps
least productive of direct spiritual results is the
work of the dispensary. A doctor settled in a
Persian town is primarily expected to see all
comers and to provide them with medicines.
Indeed the Persian will come to the European
for treatment whether he is a doctor or not.
The business of the dispensary affords an excellent
opportunity for giving an address on religious
subjects, but comparatively little for systematic
teaching of individuals, though contacts may be
made during dispensary hours that may lead to
further enquiry, and of course even systematic
teaching can be given during dispensary hours
by a determined worker.</p>

<p>Medical visiting is just what the missionary
is able to make it. The over-worked doctor
with more visits than he can pay in the day
has to be content with a very occasional reading
and a word here and there as opportunity offers;
but there is no doubt that the opportunity is
unique, and if time can be made during medical
visits for more systematic spiritual teaching, such
teaching is likely for several reasons to carry
exceptional weight. Although perhaps medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
visits give a better opportunity to the doctor who
wishes to himself follow up the work with religious
teaching, dispensary work affords a much better
opportunity for the bringing of other evangelists
into such touch with the patients as will make it
possible to find out any serious enquirers and to
rouse others to further interest. The great difficulty
in dispensary work and medical visiting,
regarded as evangelistic agencies in Persia, is
that the number of contacts is almost too large
to handle. To begin with, the staff of missionaries
is inadequate, and the difficulty is further increased
by the peculiarities of the Persian, who in most
cases is almost untouched by any teaching that is
not systematic, and that does not go somewhat
deeply into fundamentals. Of course these kinds
of medical work produce more contacts than does
anything else, but the difficulty in Persia is not
to bring people within the hearing of the Gospels,
but to convey to them something of the meaning
of the Gospel. What makes the medical mission
of the present time in Persia all-important is not
that it is absolutely necessary for the purpose of
bringing the evangelist into touch with the native,
though in certain times and places it may be still
greatly needed for this purpose; but the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
point is that it has often explained the meaning
of Christ crucified to men and women who without
it seemed unable to grasp the Christian idea.
This I believe to be true of all branches of medical
mission work that I have mentioned, but at the
same time it must be owned that the branch which
has hitherto proved most satisfactory as a direct
evangelistic agency is that connected with the
hospital. Nobody can speak too highly of the
potentialities of hospital work in Persia. It is
almost inconceivable what misunderstanding of
the doctor’s attitude is possible in out-patient
work in a Mussulman country. He is a bad
man trying to work off his sins. He is sent
out by the English Government at a high salary.
He is making a very good profit out of the work.
He is an instance of the subjection of the infidel
to the Mussulman by the power of God. All
these notions gradually die away under the
systematic life and discipline of the hospital,
with its atmosphere of trust and repose. Day
by day men meet the doctor and his assistants
and learn to know them; they see the quiet
persistence of their kindness, and its penetration
into the smallest detail; best of all, they hear
the Word of God day by day brought into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
connected story and an intelligible system of
salvation. In the best conducted hospitals the
only misconception that is likely to remain is
the belief that the missionaries as a body are
trying to win a high place in Heaven by <i>savabs</i>.
This dies very hard, and all we can say is that
the hospital system, perhaps partly by its more
definite discipline, tends to eradicate it. It is true
that some workers have produced similar results
by importing the atmosphere of Christian hospital
work into the medical visit or the dispensary;
but the point to be noted is that what is natural
in the Christian hospital has in other forms of
medical work to be deliberately and persistently
fostered. In these if the highest spiritual results
are to be obtained, there must be on the part of
the worker a determination rather to guide the
organisation towards them, than to depend on its
essential qualities as a missionary force. It is not
that hospital equipment is an essential for a
doctor who wants to preach the Gospel, but no
matter what a missionary may be, clergyman, lay
evangelist, or medical, it is only by getting into
close touch with the native, and by systematic
and persevering teaching, that he can expect to
extend Christ’s Kingdom in Persian towns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the position of the medical missionary
who is invited to the town by those in authority,
as is frequently the case, is very different from
that of most other missionaries. There may be
a real demand for school teaching, but even
when school work has been started and placed
on a satisfactory footing, it never appeals so
generally to the interest of all classes as to be
superior to any intrigue that may arise, or to
bursts of fanatical bigotry. At the same time
the medical missionary who has gone to a new
station finds that even when invited he is on
trial. When free medicines are given, as on
some occasions they have been for a short period,
two-thirds of the people throw them away
without using them. Even those who have
invited him are quite ready to turn against him,
at any rate behind his back. These difficulties,
although real, are minor ones, and there are very
few European doctors, possessed of an ordinary
amount of common-sense and a good material
equipment, who cannot get over them in a short
while. The real danger is lest the missionary
by regarding these difficulties as more serious
than they really are should become too absorbed
in his efforts to overcome them. Medical work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
is really an enormous power. It may make
possible, under God’s providence, steps and
measures which would otherwise be utterly
impossible. But if it is to be fully used to
God’s glory, these God-given powers must be
realised, and put forth to their full extent.</p>

<p>Medical and school work have one other
advantage besides those that have been mentioned,
for they enable a class of men to participate
in mission work who as ordinary evangelistic
missionaries would be useless. In the first place,
there is the newly-arrived European, who
imperfectly understands the language, and who
yet may do more or less effective work while
he is still studying, if he is connected with a
medical or educational organisation. Secondly,
if it were not for schools and medical work it
would be exceedingly difficult for the Persian
missions to employ natives, except in menial
capacities or in positions attended with the
gravest peril. Here to my mind we have one
of the greatest arguments for medical and school
work, and this from the directly evangelistic
standpoint.</p>

<p>This brings the subject of methods of work
in Persian towns like Yezd to a conclusion. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
is not impossible to work as a simple evangelist,
but it needs certain qualifications and abilities.
Generally speaking, the ordinary missionary must
be prepared to use both hands and both feet, and
to enter in whatever way seems most expedient
into the life of the town. There is no room for
university work, and technical instruction has
not yet been tried, but elementary school work
and medical work are both much needed and
much appreciated, and they further afford an
abundant field for directly evangelistic labour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>We have now seen something not only of the
Yezdi’s life, of his character, and of his mental
attitude towards the missionary, but also something
of the way in which the modern missionary
attempts to meet this attitude. Of course it
cannot be claimed that the estimate of the Yezdi’s
position that has been made in these pages is in
any way final, or that it is one with which all
acquainted with the subject would certainly
concur. To have limited myself to the greatest
common measure of opinion on such a matter
would have prevented me altogether from touching
on many questions, and would have left me
very little to say on others. As the book stands,
I can claim that it is truthful in matters of fact,
and in other things sufficiently sound to form a
basis for other people’s corrections; and as many
find it less easy to state their own views than to
combat those of other persons, I am not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
hopes that it may be useful, even if my conclusions
should prove altogether unacceptable.
Also it may be pointed out that, though I have
throughout spoken of the Yezdi and of Yezd,
these have been taken as special instances of a
Persian and his town. Other places in central
Persia may differ in particulars, but there will
in most cases be a general similarity.</p>

<p>Perhaps a short summary of the points which
have been noted in the preceding pages may not
be without value. We have seen first of all
the strange staccato effect of Persian scenery,
particularly of that which meets the eye of the
Yezdi, and have noticed how this has influenced
the Yezdi’s mind. Then we have seen the
extreme insularity of the town, and how this has
given rise to symptoms which resemble intense
fanatical bigotry, but on the other hand how
this insularity may be utilised by the foreigner
when it is once understood. Then we have tried
to discover the essential system of Islam, and to
decide whether or not the Persian Shiah has been
greatly influenced by the prophet’s life and teaching.
My own opinion is that Persia is most
strongly Mohammedan, but seeing that the point
of this book is not so much to express opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
as to give the facts that have led to their formation,
I must not complain if many of my readers
do not agree with me. An attempt has also been
made to explain the religiosity of the Mohammedan,
and to show that it is neither hypocrisy,
nor yet religion in the Western sense. Then
there was a chapter on the Yezdi’s character,
and I think that in this my main point was
to show how superficial is the judgment that
pronounces the Persian thoroughly weak and
effete. He really shows great strength of
purpose when he has a purpose, he has some
peculiar abilities, and is at bottom thoroughly
likeable and loveable, but he is spoilt by the
unhappy circumstances of his existence and very
specially by his creed.</p>

<p>After that there was an attempt to show the
peculiar nature of the search after truth that
is just now going on in Persia, and very
particularly in Yezd. That this is God’s doing,
intended to prepare the way for Christian teaching,
I have in my own mind no doubt at all;
but I have tried to describe it as a phenomenon,
and sometimes to trace it to immediate causes
where such causes are easily discoverable.
Lastly, I have tried to show that towns like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Yezd present a field, not only workable by one
class of missionary organisation, but approachable
in many different ways.</p>

<p>I sincerely trust that those who have followed
the argument of these chapters will have come
to my own conclusion, that, although there are
enormous difficulties in missionary work in Persia,
there are also enormous opportunities, and that
there is great reason to expect that in such a
country things will one day come with a rush:
further, that when the barrier of Mohammedanism
is removed, there are grounds for hoping that
Persian character will recover its equilibrium and
the nation prove by no means decadent. If in
addition the spiritual force of Christianity be
brought to bear upon the people, Persia may
prove in the future the missionary power of the
near East. Persia at this moment is full of
religious enquirers, willing to make immense
sacrifices for their convictions; and behind these
there is a mass of simple people, religiously
minded and yet utterly dissatisfied with their
present creed. There are of course great prejudices
still existing against Christianity, but
these prejudices have been by God’s blessing
broken down in individual instances, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
their nature is better realised they may more
generally disappear. It is not necessary to give
actual statistics with reference to converts: it
is enough to say that the number of those who
have come forward in Yezd is sufficient to prove
two things; firstly, that God is willing to bless
the work very fully, and secondly, that we are
not quite ready for His blessing.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>If any further proof were needed of God’s
willingness to forward the work of the Yezd
mission, it would be found in the history of the
Christian institutions in the town. The medical
work was founded by Dr Henry White about
six years and a half back, he having been in the
Isfahan district for about twelve months previous
to his arrival in Yezd. There is now not only
a men’s hospital and dispensary in the town,
but also two dispensaries in the outlying villages,
and a women’s hospital and dispensary under Dr
Elsie Taylor. In connection with the medical
work one can hardly help mentioning the name
of Miss Bird, who really founded the work
amongst the women, and that of Dr Griffith,
who did most valuable work during the furlough
of Dr White.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The site for the men’s hospital was given to
the Society shortly after Dr White’s arrival, by
the late Mr Gudarz, a prominent Parsi merchant
in the town. The medical mission in Yezd may
be said to be quite as firmly established as the
Government.</p>

<p>I myself came to Yezd six months later than
Dr White, without any previous experience of
Persia. My successor, Mr Boyland, has now
under his charge a school of about sixty boys,
Mussulmans, Babis and Parsis, with a staff of
native masters. The boys in spite of their
religious differences play football together. The
religious teaching in the school is given without
the slightest concealment. There is also a school
for Parsi girls more lately established by Miss
Brighty. In this school religious instruction is
also given. When I left Yezd the number of
the pupils was about forty.</p>

<p>I may also mention that in the chapel which
we have built in the hospital we often have
congregations of over a hundred Persians. The
chapel cost something under a hundred pounds,
and the funds were subscribed, all but twenty-five
pounds, by the members of the European
colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a great mistake to regard such work as
we have in Yezd as primarily of a preparatory
nature in view of some future opportunity.
Babiism, which is in some ways more opposed
to Christianity than the religion of the average
Persian Mussulman, is fast gaining ground, and
the exceptional opportunity, which is occasioned
by the preparation of the soil by Babi missionaries
who have not yet been successful in planting
their ideas, is fast passing away. It has been
already pointed out that there is not much hope
of real religious liberty under native rule.</p>

<p>Some people think that there are shortly
going to be changes in Persia which will entirely
deprive the British missionary of his opportunity.
If we take this view we ought to act quickly.
Taking a second and more hopeful view of the
future, other political developments which might
make religious liberty in any sense a reality,
would find us by no means in a position to make
the best use of them, unless we had a native
church gathered in time of stress and strain
upon whose judgment to rely.</p>

<p>Consequently mission work in Persia is a
matter which demands most careful consideration,
most unsparing effort, and most earnest prayer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
We ought not to lack recruits. That there are
difficulties to be solved is true, but when all has
been said the overwhelming horror of modern
Mohammedanism, the intense hopefulness of
Persian character, and last but not least, the
obvious preparation made by God in this country
for human evangelistic labours, all together
present a situation which cannot but appeal to
the Christian Englishman.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
